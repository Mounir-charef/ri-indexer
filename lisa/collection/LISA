THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND TRAINING:
A PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION.

CRITICALLY EXAMINES THE INDIAN LIBRARY SCENE. THE MANAGEMENT, OPERATION, AND
SERVICES OF MOST LIBRARIES IS INEFFICIENT AND INEFFECTIVE, RESULTING IN GRAVE
MISALLOCATION AND UNDERUTILISATION OF LIBRARY RESOURCES. LITTLE MAJOR RESEARCH
HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANSHIP COURSES ARE NOT MUCH HELP FOR
MANAGING AND OPERATING LIBRARIES EFFICIENTLY. THE MAJOR NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
HAVE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS. TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION, PROPOSES THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF AN INDIAN COUNCIL OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES RESEARCH AND
TRAINING. THE COUNCIL WOULD BE SET UP BY THE GOVERNMENT AND HAVE WELL-DEFINED
ROLES AND FUNCTIONS COVERING ALL ASPECTS OF INDIAN LIBRARIANSHIP.

FEELING THE DRAFT: QUALITY IN OUR ETHICAL DEBATE.

REPORT ON THE DRAFT CODE OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION WORKING PARTY ON ETHICS. LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION WORKERS IN THE
UK ARE LATECOMERS TO THE QUESTION OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS. A US CODE WAS
DEVELOPED IN 1938, AND OTHER PROFESSIONS HAVE HAD CODES SINCE THE 19TH
CENTURY. THE OVERRIDING REASON FOR SUCH A CODE IS THE PROTECTION OF THE
CLIENT, BUT IT ALSO OFFERS PROTECTION FOR THE PROFESSIONALS THEMSELVES, AND
COULD ENHANCE THE STATUS OF THE PROFESSION. AT THE VERY HEART OF THE LA CODE
IS RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE PROFESSIONALISM.

PROFESSIONAL ETHICS.

CRITIQUE OF THE DRAFT CODE ON PROFESSIONAL ETHICS PRODUCED BY THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION. THE CODE IS BADLY WRITTEN, CONFUSED, SILLY, CONTRADICTORY AND
THREATENS TO BRING THE LA INTO DISREPUTE. NOTES PROVIDE LITTLE ILLUMINATION;
CODES OF ETHICS DO NOT PER SE BRING PROFESSIONALISM; A LIBRARIAN'S PRIMARY
DUTY IS OFTEN TO A CORPORATE BODY; THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT POSSIBLE CONFLICTS
IN SERVICE; AND THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION IS IMPUDENT IN SUGGESTING THAT IT WILL
IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THOSE WHO FAIL TO KEEP ABREAST OF DEVELOPMENTS IN
LIBRARIANSHIP. SUGGESTS THAT THE WORKING PARTY WOULD DO WELL TO REFER TO THE

LIBRARY SCIENCE IN THEORY AND PRACTICE.

IN THE USA, UK AND COMMUNIST COUNTRIES, LIBRARY SCIENCE IS NOW FULLY
ESTABLISHED AS A SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE AND INCLUDED AMONGST UNIVERSITY
FACULTIES. SINCE THE 19TH CENTURY, HOWEVER, OPINION IN WEST GERMANY HAS BEEN
DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER LIBRARY SCIENCE HAS ITS OWN THEORETIC BASIS OR WHETHER
IT CONSISTS OF PURELY PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE. EXAMINATION OF THE RESPECTIVE
ARGUMENTS SUGGESTS THAT LIBRARY SCIENCE CAN BE REGARDED AS AN APPLIED SCIENCE
CLOSELY LINKED WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES, E.G. INFORMATION SCIENCE,
COMMUNICATION, CYBERNETICS AND LINGUISTICS. HISTORICAL ASPECTS OF
LIBRARIANSHIP EMPHASISED HITHERTO SHOULD PLAY ONLY A SUBORDINATE ROLE; THE
MAIN EMPHASIS MUST BE ON SCIENTIFICALLY BASED, ECONOMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION
LINKED WITH RESEARCH. COLOGNE IS THE ONLY GERMAN UNIVERSITY POSSESSING A
LIBRARY SCIENCE FACULTY; MORE SUCH FACULTIES ARE NEEDED TO PRODUCE LIBRARIANS
OF THE REQUIRED CALIBRE.

COUNTY LIBRARIES' REGIONAL SERVICE-PROBLEMS AND LINES OF DEVELOPMENT.

THE NORWEGIAN LIBRARY SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY IN A PHASE OF STAGNATION, PARTLY DUE
TO ECONOMIC FACTORS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES IN SEVERAL AREAS.
DISCUSSION CONTINUES ON THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISATION, AND A
RATIONALISATION PROGRAMME, NOW OVER 10 YEARS OLD, IS ATTEMPTING TO APPORTION
FUNCTIONS AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL
AUTHORITIES. COUNTY LIBRARIES, WITH THEIR TRIPLE TASK OF ADVISORY SERVICE,
INTER-LIBRARY LENDING, AND MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICE, ARE PARTICULARLY
VULNERABLE. THESE SERVICES, WHICH BENEFIT PUBLIC LIBRARIES, SCHOOL LIBRARIES
AND INDIVIDUAL READERS, COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SOME RATIONALISATION
PROPOSALS. THE FIRST 2 COULD BE MAINTAINED AND IMPROVED IF COUNTY LIBRARIES
WERE MADE NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ATTACHED TO LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES. MOBILE
SERVICES ARE POORLY DEVELOPED IN NORWAY, PARTLY BECAUSE NOT ALL AREAS ARE
GEOGRAPHICALLY SUITABLE. A RESTRUCTURING OF TH E COUNTRY'S LIBRARY SYSTEM IS
URGENTLY NEEDED, AND COUNTY LIBRARIANS MUST EVALUATE THEIR OWN POSITION AND

UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN THE 19TH CENTURY. THE REVOLUTION OF 1789 ABOLISHED

FUNCTION.

CONCLUSIONS FROM A SCANDINAVIAN SCHOOL LIBRARIANS' CONFERENCE HELD AT
LEANGKOLLEN, NORWAY, JULY 80, INCLUDED THE SCHOOL LIBRARY'S ALL-EMBRACING
FUNCTION; THE PRE-EMINENCE OF DANISH SCHOOL LIBRARIES IN SCANDINAVIA; THE NEED
FOR NORWEGIAN AUTHORITIES TO CARRY OUT THE INTENTIONS OF THE LIBRARY ACT; AND
SCHOOL LIBRARIES' IMPORTANT ROLE IN SCANDINAVIAN CULTURAL COOPERATION. TOPICS
INCLUDED A FORWARD VIEW OF THE SCHOOL'S AIMS AND CURRICULUM; THE CHALLENGE OF
SUPPLYING SUITABLE EDUCATION FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL CHILD IN THE 1980S; THE
STAFFING QUESTION, TEACHER TRAINING BEING SEEN AS MORE VALUABLE THAN ADVANCED
LIBRARY STUDIES; THE NEW TERM 'MEDIA CENTRE', APTLY DESCRIBING THE TRUE
FUNCTION OF A SCHOOL LIBRARY; AND FAIRY TALES IN EDUCATION. THE SCHOOL LIBRARY
IS AN IMPORTANT AID TOWARDS LEARNING OTHER SCANDINAVIAN LANGUAGES AT THE

THE CONSIDERATIONS FOR NEW STANDARDS IN THE FUTURE. THE NEW PROCESS VIEWS THE
EXISTING SERVICE PROGRAMME, ESTABLISHES PRIORITIES, AND CONSIDERS
MODIFICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVES WITHIN THE PROGRAMME. WHEN ALL LOCAL SERVICES
ARE COMPETING FOR THE SAME LIMITED MONIES, THE PUBLIC LIBRARY MUST USE THE

DOES RATIONALISATION MEAN CUTS IN STAFF?.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SERVICE POINTS OF
KOKKOLA PUBLIC LIBRARIES. SOON AFTER THE REORGANIZATION A NEW CENTRAL LIBRARY
WAS OBTAINED AND THE WORKLOAD WAS INCREASED GREATLY. TWICE THE LIBRARY SERVICE
APPLIED TO THE COUNCIL FOR MORE STAFF AND WERE TURNED DOWN. IN 1980 THE
COUNCIL DECIDED TO CARRY OUT AN O&M SURVEY CONCENTRATING ON THE STAFF
REQUIREMENTS. AS A RESULT IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT 2 EXTRA PERMANENT STAFF AND
5 PART-TIME STAFF SHOULD BE EMPLOYED. THE SURVEY ALSO MADE RECOMMENDATION FOR
2 FURTHER SURVEYS: TO SEE WHETHER IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO INCREASE THE USE
OF CENTRALISED CATALOGUING SERVICES AND TO LOOK AT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR.

MOBILES. ACQUISITION AND CATALOGUING ARE NOW CENTRALIZED AND LIBRARY SERVICES
LTD IS USED FOR MOST OF THE CATALOGUING. BOOKS ARE PROCESSED IN BRANCH
LIBRARIES. WHEN A NEW LIBRARY BUILDING IS BEING PLANNED THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS
IN RATIONALISATION SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT: THE USE OF CENTRALISED

ON DEMANDS TO REMODEL LIBRARY CONDITIONS AT THE 5 'OLD' UNIVERSITIES
(TECHNICAL COLLEGES) IN THE STATE OF NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA.

THE 1979/80 LIBRARY GUIDE TO THE AACHEN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FUNCTIONS
SIMULTANEOUSLY AS A CRITIQUE OF CONDITIONS AT THE LIBRARY. AACHEN IS NOW A
UNIVERSITY WITH ALMOST 30,000 STUDENTS BUT THE LIBRARY SYSTEM IS LARGELY
DECENTRALISED WITH MANY SMALL INSTITUTE LIBRARIES. SOME OF THESE HAVE BEEN
REORGANISED AND REHOUSED, BUT MANY STILL NEED TO BE RESTRUCTURED. THERE IS A
LACK OF CENTRALISATION AND COORDINATION WHICH CAN BE FOUND OUT MOST OF THE
'OLD' NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA UNIVERSITIES WHICH ARE NOT PLANNED, CAMPUS
UNIVERSITIES. THERE IS A NEED FOR A COMPLETE CATALOGUE OF LIBRARY STOCK.
LIBRARY GUIDES SUCH AS THE AACHEN EXAMPLE ARE OF GREAT VALUEAND SHOULD BE
PUBLISHED AT ALL THE LIBRARIES. IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO INTEGRATE SMALL
INSTITUTE LIBRARIES TO IMPROVE COORDINATION WORK. LIBRARIANS ARE OF THE
OPINION THAT LIBRARIES SHOULD BE TREATED AS INDIVIDUAL CASES AND THAT PLANS
AND LAWS FOR REMODELLING LIBRARY CONDITIONS SHOULD BEWARE OF GENERALISATION.

THE EXAMPLE OF THE 'MARBURG MODEL'.

CRITICAL SUMMARY OF THE PROGRESS MADE IN INTRODUCING A COORDINATED LIBRARY
SYSTEM AT MARBURG UNIVERSITY WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY SUITED AS A MODEL FOR THIS
PURPOSE BECAUSE THE CENTRAL ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUE HAD BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE
THE 19TH CENTURY AND HAD BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY EXTENDED SINCE 1962; AND NEW
BUILDINGS FOR MANY OF THE LIBRARY FACILITIES HAVE LED TO EXCELLENT LENDING
CONDITIONS AND CLOSE PROXIMITY BETWEEN UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS AND LIBRARY
SERVICES. THE COORDINATION PROGRAMME AIMS AT, AND HAS PARTIALLY REALISED THE
INTEGRATION OF MANY SMALL INSTITUTE LIBRARIES INTO 28 LIBRARY COMPLEXES WITH
52 INDEPENDANT LIBRARY UNITS. ONE IMPORTANT MEASURE IS THE CONSTRUCTION OF A
CENTRAL MEDICAL LIBRARY INTEGRATING THE PRESENT 37 DEPARTMENT LIBRARIES. IT IS

IN THE EARLY 70S THE FISCAL OUTLOOK FOR INDIANA'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS
ABYSMALLY DEPRESSING, WITH MOST LIBRARIES HAVING NO OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE
IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS. HOWEVER, AS THE DECADE
PROGRESSED, SEVERAL LEGISLATIVE BILLS FAVOURABLE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE
ENACTED. THESE FOLLOWED THE REVENUE SHARING ACT OF 1972, WHICH PERMITTED
GOVERNMENT UNITS TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEIR
OWN REVENUES WERE EXPENDED. IN 1978, REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS INCREASED
DRAMATICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE STATE LEGISLATORS' SECOND ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE
PUBLIC LIBRARIES WITH ACCESS TO REVENUE-SHARING FUNDS, WITH THE PASSAGE OF
SENATE-ENROLLED ACT NO. 208. THE OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK FOR THE 80S IS TEMPERED

ON FINNISH LIBRARY ARCHITECTURE.

THE AUTHOR IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE GROUND FLOOR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA
OF ANY LIBRARY BUILDING, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR SECONDARY ACTIVITIES.
IN JYVASKYLA LIBRARY BUILDING, AS IN MANY FINNISH LIBRARY BUILDINGS, THE
ACTUAL LIBRARY IS ACCOMMODATED ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR LEVEL. A COMPETITION FOR
A DESIGN IS NORMALLY ORGANIZED. THIS WAS ALSO THE CASE IN JYVASKYLA. THIS IS
NOT THE WAY TO GET BEST RESULTS, BECAUSE THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE ARCHITECT
AND THE LIBRARIAN ONLY BEGINS AFTER THE DESIGN IS COMPLETE. AN ARCHITECT
SHOULD BE CHOSEN CAREFULLY AND THE LIBRARIAN OR A LIBRARY EXPERT AND THE
ARCHITECT SHOULD COOPERATE THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING.

IS A FITTED CARPET HARMFUL TO ALLERGIC PEOPLE?.

FITTED CARPETS HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN LIBRARIES BECAUSE THEY CUT DOWN NOISE.
BUT IF CARPETS ARE NOT KEPT CLEAN AND ROOMS WELL VENTILATED THEY CAN CAUSE
PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM RESPIRATORY AILMENTS. NEW CARPETS DO NOT
CAUSE THIS TROUBLE. RESEARCH IN SWEDEN AND FINLAND SHOWS THAT CARPETS STAY
DIRTY EVEN AFTER GOOD VACUUMING. GIVES COMPARATIVE FIGURES FOR THE AMOUNT OF
DUST CAUSED BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOOR COVERINGS, WHICH IS WHAT CAUSES THE

PROTECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL, LIBRARIES AND COMPUTERS.

THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTERISED IDENTIFICATION HAS ALARMED MANY PEOPLE IN
DENMARK AS ELSEWHERE. UNDER AN 1978 ACT THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OFFICE HAS
ALREADY ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS ON CATALOGUING AND AUTHORS' ROYALTIES. THE MAIN
QUESTION CONCERNS THE LINKING OF BORROWER TO BOOK, THOUGH THIS WAS EQUALLY
POSSIBLE WITH OLDER ISSUE SYSTEMS. IN 2 RECENT CASES INVOLVING TERRORISM AND
MURDER, LIBRARIES HAVE RELUCTANTLY SUPPLIED POLICE WITH INFORMATION GENERALLY
REGARDED AS CONFIDENTIAL. THE LIBRARY OFFICE PROPOSES AN EXPLICIT STATEMENT OF
LIBRARIANS' DUTY TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY, ABD STRICTER CONTROL OF
OUT-OF-DATE PHOTOGRAPHIC ISSUE RECORDS. WHEN COMPUTER ISSUE SYSTEMS BECOME
COMMON, SUCH INFORMATION WILL BE MORE EASILY OBTAINED, AND THE DANISH LIBRARY
COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT IT SHOULD BE MADE IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACE A BORROWER
ONCE HIS BOOK IS RETURNED. WHILE THIS SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE 1978 ACT, ANY
FUTURE REVISION OF THE LIBRARY ACT SHOULD  STATE THE POSITION IN UNAMBIGUOUS

THE MEDIA INDEX: COMPUTER-BASED ACCESS TO NONPRINT MATERIALS.

ALTHOUGH FULL BIBLIOGRAPHIC ACCESS TO NON-PRINT MATERIALS HAS BEEN A GOAL OF
LIBRARIES, COMPLETE SUCCESS HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED. THE LIBRARY AT CALIFORNIA
STATE UNIVERSITY, LOS ANGELES, SOUGHT A WAY TO ACCESS PREVIOUSLY INACCESSIBLE
ELEMENTS OF ITS RECORDINGS COLLECTION. THE COMPUTER-BASED MEDIA INDEX WAS
DESIGNED WITH SEPARATE INDEXES FOR TITLES, SUBJECTS, AND ADDED ENTRIES

USEFUL TOOL AND IS READILY ADAPTABLE TO OTHER FORMS OF MEDIATED MATERIAL.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.

A TRUE ON-LINE CATALOGUE REQUIRES BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS OF AT LEAST 350-400
CHARACTERS PER TITLE, A MINIMUM OF 6 ACCESS POINTS, AND A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF
TERMINALS TO OFFER ALL USERS PROMPT ACCESS. A LIBRARY MAY DEVELOP AN ON-LINE
CATALOGUE BY PURCHASING SOFTWARE FROM ANOTHER LIBRARY OR JOINING A TURNKEY
SYSTEM WHEREBY A COMPANY PROVIDES ALL HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, INSTALLATION,
TRAINING, AND MAINTENANCE AT A CONTRACTED PRICE. ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN
EXAMINING THE OPTIONS INCLUDE DATA BASE CONTENT, FULLNESS OF RECORDS,
AUTHORITY CONTROL, ACCESS KEYS, BOOLEAN LOGIC, USER FRIENDLINESS, DISPLAY
FORMATS, SECURITY, AND BACK-UP PROVISION. LIBRARIES UNDERTAKING ON-LINE
CATALOGUES IN 1981 ARE PIONEERS.

INDEXING WITH NOMINAL PHRASES.

INDEXING WITH NOMINAL PHRASES IS A STRICT CONTINUATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT FROM
COORDINATE TO SYNTACTIC INDEXING. NOMINAL PHRASES ARE USER ORIENTED AND
ESPECIALLY SUITABLE FOR COMPLEX TERMS. A NOMINAL PHRASE CONSISTS OF A NUCLEUS
WITH A LEFT-HAND AND/OR RIGHT-HAND ATTRIBUTE. ATTRIBUTE AND NUCLEUS CAN OCCUR
SEVERAL TIMES AT THE SAME HIERARCHIC LEVEL. THE USE OF NOMINAL PHRASE INDEXING
IS ILLUSTRATED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF 3 MANUAL INDEXING SYSTEMS-TITUS, CASIN AND
GERDOK-AND 1 AUTOMATIC SYSTEM-DETECT. IN AUTOMATIC INDEXING WITH NOMINAL
PHRASES A COMPLETE SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS IS UNNECESSARY; EVEN SYSTEMS WITH

SURVIVING THE EIGHTIES: NEW ROLES FOR PUBLISHERS, INFORMATION SERVICE
ORGANIZATIONS, AND USERS.

(THE 1980 MILES CONRAD MEMORIAL LECTURE, PRESENTED AT THE 22ND NFAIS

RESOURCES OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITHOUT IMPACTING ADVERSELY ON SERVICES, SUCH

TRAINING. LIBRARIES MUST HELP ALL THOSE TURNING TO THEM AS A SCHOOL. HOWEVER,

A FIRST DEGREE; ONLY LIBRARIANS THEMSELVES WOULD CONSIDER THEIR OCCUPATION TO
BE A PROFESSION; AND FELLOWSHIP SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR AWARD ON AN HONORARY
BASIS (AND THEN ONLY RARELY). LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD RECOGNISE ITS MODEST PLACE
IN SOCIETY, RECRUIT THOSE WITH A NATURAL FLAIR FOR ORGANISATION, AND ORGANISE
ITSELF ALONG BUSINESSLIKE LINES TO PROVIDE A SERVICE THE NATURE OF WHICH DOES
NOT NEED EXPLICATING EXCEPT TO THOSE MORE INTERESTED IN ABSTRACT PHILOSOPHY
THAN PRACTICAL UTILITY. LIBRARIANSHIP IS MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN RHETORIC THAN

THE HANDICAPPED ARE DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR SPREADING KNOWLEDGE OF

MAKING ACTIVITIES UNAVAILABLE. IT IS THEREFORE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SOCIETY
AND INDIVIDUALS TO SEE THAT OBSTACLES ARE REMOVED NOT JUST TO BETTER LIVING
CONDITIONS, BUT ALSO TO A FULL CULTURAL LIFE FOR THE HANDICAPPED. THE DEMAND
FOR INFORMATION ON MATERIAL FOR THE HANDICAPPED AVAILABLE IN LIBRARIES WAS
SHOWN IN A CAMPAIGN LED BY KALMAR REGIONAL LIBRARY TO BE GROWING AMONG
TEACHERS TRYING TO INTEGRATE THE HANDICAPPED IN SCHOOLS. STAFF WITHIN THE
SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS CAN ALSO ACT AS LINKS BETWEEN THE HANDICAPPED AND THE
LIBRARY. THE REGIONAL LIBRARY MUST STIMULATE LOCAL LIBRARIES TO INITIATE
DOMICILIARY SERVICES AND ESTABLISH SYSTEMS FOR LENDING OF SPEAKING BOOKS AND
PERSONAL CONTACTS WITH USERS. THE MASS MEDIA AND SPECIAL TEACHERS ARE OTHER
MEANS OF REACHING THE HANDICAPPED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT LIBRARY SERVI CES.

SUCH A POLICY ON THE NEEDS OF THE HANDICAPPED EXIST. DESPITE OUR CONCERN FOR
FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, MANY HANDICAPPED ARE DENIED ACCESS TO THE SPOKEN AND
PRINTED WORD. LIBRARIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE THEIR CULTURAL ACTIVITIES
AVAILABLE TO ALL. DIRECT PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT THE HANDICAPPED CAN
REACH THE LIBRARY, ENTER IT AND STAY THERE. BUT IMPROVED BUILDINGS AND
TRANSPORT CANNOT REPLACE THE DOMICILIARY LIBRARY SERVICE. INDIRECT
ACCESSIBILITY MEANS THAT LIBRARY ACTIVITIES AND MEDIA MUST BE ADAPTED TO REACH
NEW GROUPS. 'EASY READERS' ARE AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A MEDIUM AND THEIR
PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION THROUGH LIBRARIES ARE DISCUSSED. THE NEW STATE
LIBRARY FOR SPEECH AND BRAILLE PRINTING IS THE 1ST STAGE IN PROVISION FOR THE
BLIND AND PARTIALLY-SIGHTED; THE NEXT IS THE INCREASED DISTRIBUTION OF SUCH
MATERIAL TO OTHER GROUPS.

THE LIBRARY FOR TALKING BOOKS AND BRAILLE (TPB) WAS ESTABLISHED ON 1 JAN 80

MEDIUM. FROM THE START THE BOOKS WERE AVAILABLE IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE
BOOKS ARE SOLD AT COST PRICE BY THE LIBRARY SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
THE PROVISION WAS THE SUBJECT OF SEVERAL REPORTS, ABOVE ALL THE HANDICAP
COMMISSION'S REPORT CULTURE FOR ALL, 1976. DIRECT LOANS TO INDIVIDUALS FROM

INFORMATION EDUCATION OF PUPILS AND THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER.

THE 'INFORMATION EDUCATION' OF SCHOOL CHILDREN IS NOT JUST THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF LIBRARIANS, BUT IT SHOULD BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE MODERN TEACHING
PROCESS IN EVERY SUBJECT. SCHOOL LIBRARIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY OPERATED ON A
RUDIMENTARY LEVEL AS BOOKSTOCKS WITH LENDING OUTLETS-MOSTLY SUPPLYING
LITERATURE RELEVANT TO THE TEACHING OF THE MOTHER TONGUE. THIS IS NO LONGER
ADEQUATE AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES MUST BE TRANSFORMED INTO UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION
AND STUDY CENTRES. THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF EDUCATION HAS ISSUED A DIRECTIVE NO
3767/1979 WHICH ENVISAGES SCHOOL LIBRARIES FULFILLING 3 ROLES' SUPPLYING
LIBRARY AND INFORMATION MATERIAL TO BOTH TEACHERS AND PUPILS; CONTRIBUTING TO
THE UPBRINGING OF THE NEW SOCIALIST GENERATION THROUGH WORKING WITH BOOKS;

THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF PUBLIC LIBRARY USER

THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHICAL MODEL'
PUBLIC LIBRARY USE IS A FUNCTION OF (1) INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS; (2)
AWARENESS OF LIBRARY SERVICES; (3) PERCEIVED ACCESSIBILITY OF THE LIBRARY; (4)
PERCEIVED EASE OF USE OF THE LIBRARY; AND (5) USE OF OTHER NON-PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. THE MODEL WAS TESTED WITH 4 DIFFERENT LIBRARY USE MEASURES-A
DICHOTOMISED MEASURE OF USE AND NONUSE, AND, AMONG LIBRARY USERS, FREQUENCY OF
USE AND 2-FACTOR ANALYTICALLY DERIVED INDEXES DESCRIPTIVE OF 2 DISTINCTLY
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY USE. TYPE 1 USE APPEARED TO MEASURE USE INTENSITY;
TYPE 2-IN-HOUSE USE. INTERVIEW DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 202 RESIDENTS OF
SYRACUSE, NEW YORK. RESULTS INDICATED THAT PUBLIC LIBRARY USERS PERCEIVED THE
LIBRARY AS MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN DID NONUSERS, AND USE FREQUENCY WAS RELATED TO
AWARENESS OF SPECIAL LIBRARY PROGRAMMES, AS WAS INTENSITY OF USE, AND IN-HOUSE
USE WAS RELATED  TO USE OF OTHER LIBRARIES.

LIBRARIES AND SCIENCE.

THE MAIN CONCERN OF LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES SHOULD BE SPEEDY AND
EFFECTIVE SERVICE TO USERS. THEY MUST BE CONCERNED TO ELIMINATE ANY
UNNECESSARY DELAYS, WHICH MAY CAUSE DELAYS IN THE SCIENTIST'S WORK. LIBRARIANS
SHOULD TAKE AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE WORK OF THEIR USERS AND THEIR EDUCATION
AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO SO. A SURVEY IN THE SLOVAK
ACADEMY OF SCIENCE HAD SHOWN THAT MOST SOUGHT AFTER ARE INFORMATION SOURCES
1-3 YEARS OLD IN NATURAL SCIENCES AND MEDICINE, 1-10 YEARS OLD IN THE SOCIAL
SCIENCES. GOOD ACQUISITION POLICY, QUALITY IN BIBLIOGRAPHICAL AND INFORMATION

LIMITING FACTORS IN THIS LIBRARY THAN EITHER CIRCULATION OR LIBRARY ERROR. IT
IS RECOMMENDED THAT FURTHER STUDY BE MADE OF THE EXTENT OF USE OF THE HOLDINGS
OF OTHER LIBRARIES, AND OF THE PROPORTION OF USERS WHO COME TO BROWSE OR
SEARCH BY SUBJECT RATHER THAN SPECIFIC TITLE, BEFORE CHANGING ACQUISITIONS

SOME ASPECTS OF THE LIBRARIAN-USER RELATIONSHIP.

ARGUES THAT DIRECT LIBRARIAN-USER INTERACTION IS LONG OVERDUE FOR CLOSE
SCRUTINY, SINCE THIS RELATIONSHIP MAY NOT BE IN HARMONY WITH THE OVERALL
STANDARD OF OTHER SUBSYSTEMS OF THE INFORMATION CENTRE. POINTS OUT THAT, APART
FROM QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE, A LIBRARIAN MUST ALSO POSSESS A
PERSONALITY WHICH IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY WELL BALANCED AND ADAPTABLE, SINCE A
GREAT DEAL OF HIS/HER WORK INVOLVES EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY STRESSFUL
SITUATIONS. THESE SITUATIONS ARISE WITH USERS WHO ARE POORLY INFORMED ABOUT
THE PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINING A PARTICULAR INFORMATION
SOURCE AND WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO APPRECIATE THAT OTHER READERS HAVE THEIR
PRESSING REQUIREMENTS AS WELL. NAME TAGS FOR LIBRARIANS SHOULD LEAD TO GREATER
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. IN LARGE LIBRARIES DIRECT USER CONTACT INVOLVES SHIFT
WORKING FOR THE PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE STAFF; THIS LEADS TO DIFFICULTIES AND
SOMETIMES LESS THAN ADEQUATE PERSONNEL ARE EXPOSED TO THE PU BLIC. THIS AREA
OF LIBRARY SERVICES CRIES OUT FOR A SYSTEMATIC OVERHAUL.

PROBLEMS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL SOON MAKE THE LIBRARIES' TASK OF KEEPING UP

INDIVIDUAL FEATURES WHICH CAN PROVIDE A FOCAL POINT IN PUBLIC RELATIONS.
LIBRARIANS MUST ESTABLISH GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER LOCAL CULTURAL
ORGANISATIONS, WHO WILL THEN SUPPORT CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IN THE LIBRARY,

THERE IS STILL MUCH TO BE DONE.

CENTRALISATION IS PRACTICALLY COMPLETE IN RSFSR (RUSSIAN SOVIET FEDERATE OF
SOCIALIST REPUBLIC). IN 1980, 2,200 CENTRALISED LIBRARY SYSTEMS, (CLS),
OPERATED IN RUSSIA, UNITING 50,000 LIBRARIES. BUT PROBLEMS OF ACQUISITIONS AND
STOCK-EXPLOITATION HAMPER CLS. MANY CENTRAL LIBRARIES COMPLAIN OF A
DETERIORATION OF ACQUISITIONS, ESPECIALLY OF FICTION AND CHILDREN'S
LITERATURE. BOOK-ORDERING DEPARTMENTS DO NOT FULFIL CLS ORDERS, BUT DUMP
UNWANTED BOOKS ON THEM. RELATIONS BETWEEN BOOKSELLERS AND LIBRARIES NEED
OVERHAULING. BOOKSELLERS SHOULD BE REWARDED FOR FULFILLING LIBRARIES' BOOK
ORDERS. INCREASED FINES MAY PREVENT LOSS OF BOOKS. CLS NEED BINDING EQUIPMENT
FOR BOOK REPAIRS AND SHOULD IMPROVE BOOK USE BY INTRA-SYSTEM BOOK-EXCHANGE,

A QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS IN HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARIES.

A GOAL OF LIBRARIES IS TO ASSURE THE IMPROVEMENT OF LIBRARY SERVICES. MANY USE
STANDARDS AS A METHOD OF ASSURING THE QUALITY OF SERVICES, BUT STANDARDS HAVE

A MEASURE OF LIBRARY PERFORMANCE IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THE PATRON CAN FIND
THE MATERIAL SOUGHT. THIS PARAMETER, DOCUMENT AVAILABILITY, IS BEST MEASURED
BY SAMPLING THE EXPRESSED DEMAND. SAMPLING THE SHELF-LIST IS FAR LESS
INTRUSIVE, BUT FAILS TO PROVIDE DATA ON COLLECTION ADEQUACY, USER CATALOGUE
AND SHELF SKILLS, AND FACTORS INHIBITING AVAILABILITY (SUCH AS CIRCULATION).
DESCRIBES A SIMPLE TECHNIQUE FOR ADJUSTING SHELF-LIST DATA TO REFLECT
EXPRESSED DEMAND RESULTS AND PRESENTS A WORKED EXAMPLE, EXPLAINING THE STEPS

THE LAW FOR LOCAL AUTHORITY CULTURAL ACTIVITIES IS ONE MORE ON THE ROAD FOR
LEGISLATING CULTURAL ACTIVITIES.

THE NEW LAW CAME INTO EFFECT AT THE BEGINNING OF 1981. A LOCAL AUTHORITY HAS
TO SET UP A COMMITTEE FOR CULTURAL ACTIVITIES. OUT OF 84 TOWNS ONLY 9 HAD SUCH
A COMMITTEE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR. ALL OTHER TYPES OF LOCAL
AUTHORITIES, 150 OF THEM, DID NOT HAVE ONE. THE DUTIES OF THE COMMITTEES ARE
THE OVERSIGHT AND INSTIGATION OF CULTURAL ACTIVITIES, COOPERATION BETWEEN
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES PUBLICITY, PROVISION OF ACCOMMODATION, AND
BUDGET. FROM 1982 STATE GRANTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR STAFF AND ORGANISATION
COSTS. THE NEW LAW SHOULD EASE THE WORK OF LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS WHO UNTIL
NOW HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ORGANISATION OF MANY OF THE LOCAL CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES.

MUSIC IN THE LIBRARY.

EVERYONE WHO WISHES SHOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN MUSICAL RECORDINGS OF INTEREST TO
THEM AND RELATED REFERENCE MATERIAL. BUT SOME READERS NEED QUALIFIED
SPECIALIST HELP. MOST PEOPLE VISIT THE MUSIC LIBRARY HOPING TO FIND SOME SORT
OF CLUB. LIBRARIANS MUST ESTIMATE WHICH RESOURCES WOULD ACHIEVE THE MUSIC
LIBRARY'S AIMS. A LARGE RECORD LIBRARY AND GOOD TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT ARE
ESSENTIAL. SERIES OF SLIDES ACCOMPANYING THE MUSIC CREATE A BETTER ARTISTIC
AND HISTORIC ATMOSPHERE. THE LIBRARIAN SHOULD OBSERVE ALL NEW EVENTS IN THE
MUSICAL WORLD, MAINTAINING CLOSE CONTACT WITH HIS AUDIENCE'S INTERESTS AND
DEVELOPING INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP ACTIVITIES TO MAKE THE MUSIC SECTION A CENTRE

THE COMPATIBILITY OF LIBRARY SYSTEMS.

THERE ARE 2 WAYS TO ACHIEVE SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY' DEVELOP OR ACQUIRE AN

INFORMATION, REDUCE THE OVERHEAD REQUIRED FOR SEPARATE SYSTEMS OPERATIONS, AND
MAKE CONVERSION TO FUTURE TECHNOLOGY MORE FEASIBLE. PLANNING FOR COMPUTER

INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY. THE NECESSITY OF PLANNING IS ILLUSTRATED BY
EXAMPLES OF VARIOUS CANADIAN UNIVERSITY PROJECTS, AND THE SOPHISTICATED
MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES OF TODAY COMPARED WITH THE EARLY EXPERIMENTAL PHASE IN

GROUP PROCESSING OF LITERATURE.

LARGE LIBRARIES ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THEIR CATALOGUES AND,
AT THE SAME TIME, TO SIMPLIFY THE RETRIEVAL OF INDIVIDUAL INDEXED ITEMS. THE
BULK OF LIBRARY STOCK MUST BE INDEXED INDIVIDUALLY, HOWEVER, THERE IS A
CERTAIN TYPE OF LITERATURE, SUCH AS INFORMATION LEAFLETS, PROMOTIONAL
LITERATURE, WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR GROUP PROCESSING (1 CATALOGUE CARD IS USED
FOR A SERIES OF ITEMS FOR EXAMPLE). THE MAIN LIBRARY OF LENINGRAD POLYTECHNIC
PREPARED 'INSTRUCTIONS FOR GROUP PROCESSING OF INFORMATION LITERATURE' IN
1977. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS IS DISCUSSED. IT IS SHOWN THAT
GROUP PROCESSING OF CERTAIN TYPES OF LITERATURE CAN CONSIDERABLY INCREASE THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF CATALOGUING, DECREASE LABOUR CONSUMPTION AND REDUCE THE SIZE

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO RADIO, TELEVISION, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS WILL
LIKELY APPLY TO VIDEOTEX, ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT TRANSMISSION MECHANISMS MAY WELL
BE REGULATED DIFFERENTLY. IT IS UNCERTAIN IF THE COPYRIGHT LAW IN CANADA
COVERS INFORMATION STORED IN COMPUTERS SUCH AS THAT WHICH WOULD BE CONTAINED
IN A VIDEOTEX SYSTEM. VIDEOTEX SERVICES ORIGINATING OUTSIDE CANADA WOULD BE

ON THE INTRODUCTION OF VIEWDATA IN THE FIELD OF INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTATION.
PART 1.

'BILDSCHIRMTEXT' (BTX) IS A VIEWDATA SYSTEM SIMILAR TO PRESTEL WHICH IS BEING
DEVELOPED IN WEST GERMANY BY THE FEDERAL POST OFFICE. BTX REGISTERED USERS
WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER THE SYSTEM BY TELEPHONE. A COLOUR TELEVISION SCREEN AS A
DISPLAY DEVICE AND AN INSTRUMENT WITH A DIGITAL KEYBOARD WILL ALSO BE
NECESSARY. INFORMATION PROVIDERS WILL NEED A KEYBOARD SIMILAR TO THAT OF A
TYPEWRITER WITH SOME ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS TO OBTAIN GRAPHICS. AT PRESENT THE
SYSTEM IS MAINLY ORIENTED TO USERS WITH DIGITAL KEYBOARDS WHICH MEANS THAT ALL
INFORMATION HAS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH NUMERICAL IDENTIFICATION.
FACILITY SELECTION IS MADE THROUGH AN INDEX PROCESS PREPARED BY THE USER. THE
PROCEDURE COULD BE SPEEDED UP BY CREATING A USERS' CATALOGUE SUCH AS PRESTEL
PROVIDES. IF BTX STORAGE FACILITIES ARE EXPANDED AND THE SPEED OF ACCESS IS
IMPROVED IT SHOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL POSSIBILITIES FOR CONNECTING GENERAL AND
T ECHNICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS. CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO INTEGRATE THIS NEW

SEMANTIC LIMITATION IN FREETEXT RETRIEVAL BASED ON MORPHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION.

THE BASIC PROBLEM IN FREETEXT RETRIEVAL IS THAT THE RETRIEVAL LANGUAGE IS NOT
PROPERLY ADAPTED TO THAT OF THE AUTHOR. MORPHOLOGICAL SEGMENTATION, WHERE
WORDS WITH THE SAME ROOT ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN THE INVERTED FILE, IS A GOOD
ELIMINATOR OF NOISE AND INFORMATION LOSS, PROVIDING HIGH RECALL BUT LOW
PRECISION. PRECISION CAN BE INCREASED THROUGH THE PROCESS DESCRIBED, WHEREBY
SEMANTIC INFORMATION FROM THE MORPHOLOGICAL PERIPHERY OF THE ROOTS CAN BE
OBTAINED, WHICH CAN BE VERY RELEVANT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL. THE PROCESS
INVOLVES RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH DERIVATIVE SUFFIXES, PREFIXES AND COMPOSITE
TERMS, PLUS THE USE OF LINK OPERATORS; VARIOUS FORMULATION POSSIBILITIES ARE
ILLUSTRATED. AUTOMATIC INCLUSION OF AUTONOMOUS WORD STRUCTURES IS ALLOWED.

HOW CAN WE USE LIBRARY RESEARCH?.

INTRODUCTIONS TO A DEBATE HELD AT THE 14TH NORDIC LIBRARY MEETING IN STOCKHOLM
AUG 80. O. HARBO DISTINGUISHES 4 TYPES OF LIBRARY RESEARCH AND THEIR USES. THE
MOST IMPORTANT IS RESEARCH IN THE LIBRARY PROFESSIONAL AREA, I.E. RESEARCH
INTO ACQUISITION, STORING AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION. THE RESULTS CAN BE
USED DIRECTLY, OR INDIRECTLY FOR THE EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT OF THE PERSON
CARRYING OUT THE RESEARCH. MANY LARGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS CAN ONLY BE CARRIED
OUT BY CENTRAL LIBRARY BODIES. M. OKKO POINTS TO THE DANGERS OF LIBRARY
RESEARCH WHICH IS CARRIED OUT FOR ITS USEFULNESS ONLY AND IIS DIRECTED BY
OUTSIDE INTERESTS. THE THEORETICAL RESULTS OF BASIC LIBRARY SCIENCE MUST
PERMEATE THE PROFESSIONAL THINKING AND PRACTICE. B. QUENTZER DETECTS A
MISTRUST OF SCIENTIFIC THINKING IN LIBRARIES. EDUCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP MUST
BE CHANGED SO THAT IT IS MORE PROBLEM ORIENTATED AND CRITICAL, THUS AN
INTEREST IN LIBRARY RESEARCH CAN BE BUILT UP. INCLUDES CONTRIBUTIONS TO  THE

BRANCH AND MOBILE LIBRARIES GROUP WEEKEND SCHOOL, LYTHAM ST. ANNES, OCT-NOV
80. ALTHOUGH INCOME-GENERATING INNOVATIONS WILL HELP THE PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE
SHORT TERM, THE RESULTANT REVENUE WILL ALWAYS BE A RELATIVELY SMALL PROPORTION
OF THE BUDGET AND SUCH ACTIVITIES COULD PREJUDICE THE LIBRARY'S LONG TERM
SURVIVAL BY GIVING THE PUBLIC THE WRONG IMPRESSION. ONLY A MORE BUSINESS-LIKE,
PLANNED, BALANCED APPROACH THAN PREVIOUSLY PRACTISED CAN SAVE THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY. MARKETING CAN OFFER SUCH AN APPROACH. THE LIBRARY SHOULD TAILOR

OF MEETING CITIZENS' INFORMATION NEEDS. RESIDENTS FROM 2,400 RANDOMLY-SELECTED
HOUSEHOLDS IN THE NEW ENGLAND STATES OF THE USA PARTICIPATED IN 15-MINUTE
TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS, JULY-OCT 79. IT APPEARS THAT THEY INFREQUENTLY CONSULT
LIBRARIES AS AN INFORMATION RESOURCE IN WORK OR NON-WORK SITUATIONS. OF THE
17% USING LIBRARIES, THE MAJORITY (11%) DO NOT HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THE
LIBRARY AS AN INFORMATION PROVIDER. TO BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE COMPETITORS WITH
OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDERS, LIBRARIES MUST PUBLICISE RESOURCES AND SERVICES
MORE EFFECTIVELY, IMPROVE DOCUMENT DELIVERY CAPABILITY, AND IDENTIFY AND

AN OVERVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF FUNDING RESTRICTIONS ON LARGE US ACADEMIC
LIBRARIES DURING 1969-78. THROUGH MOST OF THE DECADE, THE LIBRARIES RELIED ON
A SERIES OF STRATEGIES DESIGNED TO MINIMISE OR HIDE THEIR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS,
SHIFTING FROM MONOGRAPHIC TO SERIALS EXPENDITURE AND ELIMINATING DUPLICATES.
ONLY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE THEY BEEN FORCED TO TURN TO CONSORTIA AND

PROBLEMS SQUARELY IN THE 1980S AND PRODUCE LEADERS WITH THE ASTUTENESS,
COURAGE, AND PERSUASIVENESS TO MAKE FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS UNDERSTAND THE
PROBLEMS. ONLY THEN, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ACCORD, WILL

BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL VERSUS AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS' THE PROBLEM OF
SELECTION.

LIBRARIANS ARE CONSTANTLY FACED WITH THE TASK OF SUPPLYING LITERATURE ON
RAPIDLY DEVELOPING SUBJECTS, ESPECIALLY IN TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICINE. MECHANICAL
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IS APT TO YIELD VAST AMOUNTS OF REFERENCES WHICH HAVE TO
BE WEEDED OUT. CRITERIA FOR THIS VARY, BUT ARE USUALLY DICTATED BY NECESSITY,
NAMELY THE ACTUAL AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS. THUS THE USER CAN READILY BE
SUPPLIED WITH THE RELEVANT LITERATURE IN WELL KNOWN JOURNALS STOCKED BY THE
LIBRARY. IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE USER GETS A GOOD COVERAGE INITIALLY,
OR WHETHER HE MUST INSIST ON TOTAL RETRIEVAL OF DOCUMENTS. THE PROBLEM OF
SELECTION WILL PROBABLY BECOME MORE ACUTE IN THE FUTURE. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION
IS TO ANALYSE THE GROWTH AND SPREAD OF PAPERS RELEVANT TO A SPECIFIC TOPIC IN
BROADER BASED JOURNALS.

SERIALS DEPARTMENTS' DOOMED TO EXTINCTION?.

BECAUSE TASKS AND MATERIALS RELATED TO SERIALS PROCESSING AND USE ARE OFTEN
DISPERSED IN A LIBRARY, SERIALS SPECIALISTS MUST DEVELOP PERSONAL INFLUENCE
STRATEGIES AND USE INFORMAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS WHICH CROSS ORGANISATIONAL
BOUNDARIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, SERIALS SPECIALISTS AND
INFORMAL SERIALS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST. IT IS WIDELY
AGREED THAT INFORMAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS EMERGE SPONTANEOUSLY IN
ORGANISATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH NO FORMALLY CONFERRED AUTHORITY MAY USE
VARIOUS TYPES OF PERSONAL INFLUENCE STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE ORGANISATIONAL
OBJECTIVES. WHILE SERIALS PROCESSING AND PUBLIC SERVICE COULD BE MOST
EFFICIENTLY HANDLED THROUGH A SERIALS DEPARTMENT, INFORMAL COMMUNICATION
SYSTEMS, UTILISED BY SERIALS SPECIALISTS, WILL DEVELOP IF SUCH A DEPARTMENT

THE SYSTEM IS THE SOLUTION' AN APPROACH TO INCREASED TECHNICAL SERVICES
PRODUCTIVITY.

IN 1978, ONTARIO'S UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO DISCOVERED A BACKLOG OF BOOKS IN ITS
CATALOGUING DEPARTMENT AFTER A CATALOGUING REVISION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
FULL MARC CODING. A NEW APPROACH TO COPING WITH THE BACKLOG PROVED VERY
SUCCESSFUL. A 5-POINT PROCEDURE WAS FOLLOWED' (1) EVALUATE PRESENT OPERATION
AND VARIOUS TASKS; (2) ANALYSE THESE TASKS TO DETECT NON-PRODUCTIVE AREAS OR
AREAS IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT; (3) DESIGN A SOLUTION; (4) DOCUMENT THE NEW
PROCEDURES; AND (5) IMPLEMENT THE SOLUTION. THE PROCEDURES HIGHLIGHTED THE
FACT THAT MORE TIME WAS SPENT IN FINDING CATALOGUE COPY THAN IN ANY OTHER
TASK. WHEN THIS TIME WAS CUT DOWN THROUGH THE USE OF THE MARC DISTRIBUTION
SERVICE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY, THE SYSTEM PROVED SUITABLY STREAMLINED TO
ELIMINATE THE BACKLOG IN THE CATALOGUING DEPARTMENT.

EVALUATION OF THE ONLINE SEARCH PROCESS.

THE STUDY EVALUATED ON-LINE SEARCHING PERFORMED ON THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF
MEDICINE SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY IMPLICATIONS FOR TRAINING AND CONTINUING
EDUCATION. SEARCHERS WERE SELECTED WITH FORMAL AND INFORMAL TRAINING, FROM 3
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ORGANISATION, AND WITH DIFFERING LEVELS OF EXPERIENCE. IT
WAS FOUND THAT MOST SEARCHERS HAVE MASTERED THE BASICS OF SEARCHING, AND THAT
PERFORMANCE WAS UNAFFECTED BY SOURCE OF TRAINING, EXPERIENCE, ORGANISATIONAL,
OR EVEN SUBJECT EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND. THE MOST CONSISTENT SOURCE OF
DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE WAS THE DIFFICULTY OF THE SEARCH ITSELF. REPORT NOT

PROCESSING OF PATENT BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA AT CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE.

CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS SERVICE (CAS) HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH CHEMICAL PATENT
INFORMATION SINCE IT BEGAN IN 1907. BY THE EARLY 1970S, ITS MANUAL DATA
PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR PATENTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF STRAIN WITH A MILLION
RECORDS ALREADY AND 200,000 BEING ADDED ANNUALLY. TO CONVERT TO A COMPUTERISED
SYSTEM WOULD REQUIRE 25,000 MAN-HOURS IF EXISTING RECORDS WERE TO BE CONTAINED
IN THE NEW SYSTEM. THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM WAS FOUND IN 1977. AN
AGREEMENT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH INPADOC (THE INTERNATIONAL PATENT DOCUMENTATION
CENTRE) FOR INPADOC TO DELIVER TO CAS A BACK-FILE OF 1.2 MILLION PATENT
RECORDS IN COMPUTER-READABLE FORM AND WEEKLY TAPES OF CURRENT PATENT
BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. DESCRIBES HOW CAS SELECTS PATENTS FROM THE TAPES
AND THE FORMAT OF THE NEW PATENT INDEX, DERIVED FROM THE INPADOC DATA AND

A SET OF EXPERIMENTS WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE SUITABILITY OF THE COLON
CLASSIFICATION AS A FOUNDATION FOR THE AUTOMATED ANALYSIS, REPRESENTATION AND
RETRIEVAL OF PRIMARY INFORMATION FROM THE FULL TEXT OF DOCUMENTS. FULL TEXT
DATA BASES WERE CREATED IN 2 SUBJECT AREAS AND QUERIES SOLICITED FROM

LIBRARY STOCK AS A SYSTEM OF PARTIAL BOOKSTOCKS.

IN A PARTICULAR LIBRARY THE BOOKSTOCK IS A HETEROGENOUS ENTITY WHICH CONSISTS
OF MATERIALS IN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AND LANGUAGES, WITH DIFFERENT CHRONOLOGICAL
AND REGIONAL CONNOTATIONS WHICH SERVE A BROAD SPECTRUM OF READERS. THUS, THE
AVAILABLE BOOKSTOCK NATURALLY SUBDIVIDES INTO A NUMBER OF ENTITIES WHICH
BELONG TO THE SAME CATEGORY AND THE SUBJECT MATTER APPEARS TO BE THE MOST
IMPORTANT CRITERION. LARGE LIBRARIES IN SLOVAKIA E.G. UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
HAVE SPECIFIC READING ROOMS FOR PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK E.G. NATURAL SCIENCES OR
LIBRARIANSHIP. SPECIAL PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK MAY CONSIST OF INTERNAL PUBLICATIONS
SUCH AS THESES, RESEARCH REPORTS, INTERNAL TRANSLATIONS AND OTHERS. IN DEALING
WITH PARTIAL BOOKSTOCK IT IS IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH THE TYPE OF READER USING
IT (E.G. CHILDREN), THE PHYSICAL FORM OF THE STOCK (TRADITIONAL OR MICRO),
GEOGRAPHICAL RELEVANCE AND THE FREQUENCY OF ITS USAGE. THE DIFFERENTIAL ASPECT
OF BOOKSTOCK IS WELL WORTH BEARING I N MIND FOR THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF

HAS THE 'IN-HOUSE' SYNDROME GONE TOO FAR?.

THE 1959 NATIONAL PRINTING STRIKE FORCED MANY COMPANIES AND ORGANISATIONS TO
INSTALL IN-HOUSE PRINTING UNITS, AND MANY LATER ADDED MICROFORM UNITS. THE LOW
AVERAGE QUALITY OF MICROFORM PRODUCED AND THE POOR ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF SUCH
UNITS, SUGGEST THAT PERHAPS IN THESE TIMES OF RECESSION AND INCREASING
COMPETITION IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR MANY LARGE ORGANISATIONS TO CUT BACK
ON SUCH LUXURIES AND START TO SUPPORT SMALL LOCAL SERVICE BUSINESSMEN MORE.

PAPER PRESENTED AND THE MICROGRAPHICS IN BANKING AND INSURANCE SEMINAR,
BRISTOL, MAR 80. PRESENTS AN OUTLINE OF THE STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION OF THE
GUARDIAN ROYAL EXCHANGE ASSURANCE COMPANY, A COMPOSITE INSURANCE COMPANY

IMPORTANT, SINCE, ALTHOUGH MICROFILM IS ACCEPTED BY COURTS, THE EVIDENCE ON IT
MAY NOT BE ACCEPTED. USE OF MICROFILM TO SAVE SPACE IN KEEPING RECORDS HAS TO
BE SIMPLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE. A PILOT SCHEME WAS LAUNCHED AT 5 BRANCHES, USING
16 OF THE LARGEST AND MOST SUITABLE TABULATIONS FOR MICROFILM. A REPORT ON
PROBLEMS IN THE USE OF MICROFILM WAS PRODUCED, HIGHLIGHTING RESISTANCE TO
CHANGE, AND CRITICISMS OF THE MICROREADER. A MODIFIED FRONT PROJECTION READER
WAS OBTAINED AND WAS RECEIVED WITH MUCH ACCLAIM. THE CONVERSION OF COMPUTER

HOW SHALL THE LIBRARY APPROACH THE IMMIGRANTS?.
     
THE LIBRARY SERVICES TO IMMIGRANTS IN DENMARK ARE GOVERNED BY THE GENERAL RULE
OF EQUAL ACCESS TO LIBRARY SERVICES. FOR PRACTICAL REASONS, THIS MEANS THAT
PART OF THE SERVICE MUST BE CENTRALISED, VIZ. SELECTION, ACQUISITION AND
PREPARATION OF THE MATERIAL. GENTOFTE PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS SINCE 1970 HAD A
CENTRAL COLLECTION OF IMMIGRANT LITERATURE AVAILABLE TO OTHER LIBRARIES. THE
CHOICE OF MATERIAL MUST BE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH PEOPLE KNOWLEDGEABLE
ABOUT THE GROUPS AND THEIR CONDITIONS IN THE NEW COUNTRY. THE SELECTION MUST
ALSO REFLECT THE NEED, NOT ONLY FOR FICTIONAL, BUT ALSO FOR INFORMATIVE
LITERATURE BOTH ABOUT THE HOMELAND AND THE ADOPTED COUNTRY. MORE AUDIO-VISUAL
MATERIAL AND A BETTER CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM ARE NECESSARY. THE EFFORTS OF THE
LOCAL LIBRARY CATERING FOR VERY SMALL GROUPS OF IMMIGRANTS MUST, APART FROM
COLLECTIONS OF REFERENCE WORKS AND CLASSICS, BE CONCENTRATED ON CONTACT WORK
AND CULTURAL ARRANGEMENTS.

THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SCIENCE LITERATURE AS SHOWN BY A LARGE-SCALE CITATION
ANALYSIS.
     
TO COLLECT INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF SECONDARY SERVICES, AN
ANALYSIS OF 59,000 CITATIONS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES WAS CONDUCTED-11,000 TAKEN
FROM 300 MONOGRAPHS, AND 48,000 FROM 140 SERIALS, INCLUDING 47 HIGHLY CITED
TITLES AND 47 TAKEN AT RANDOM. LARGE DIFFERENCES WERE APPARENT BETWEEN
ANALYSES OF REFERENES TAKEN FROM SERIALS AND THOSE FROM MONOGRAPHS, AND
SMALLER DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANALYSES OF REFERENCES FROM HIGHLY CITED AND
RANDOMLY CHOSEN SERIALS. THERE WERE ALSO GREAT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SUBJECTS;
MOST OF THESE DIFFERENES HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PLANNING OF SECONDARY
SERVICES. THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT SECONDARY SERVICES IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES ARE
DEFICIENT IN THE RANGE OF FORMS OF MATERIAL THEY COVER, IN THE NUMBER AND
POSSIBLY THE SELECTION OF SERIALS COVERED, IN THE SUBJECT SPREAD OF MATERIAL
OF POSSIBLE RELEVANCE, AND PROBABLY ALSO OF FOREIGN LANGUAGE MATERIAL AND
MATERIAL PUBLISHED IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES.

POSTERITY. MANY INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALREADY AMASSED TOO MANY PHOTOGRAPHS, AND SO

ENUMERATES AND COMMENTS ON THE MANY FACTORS THAT CAUSE INCREASED NEED FOR
ACADEMIC LIBRARY SPACE. SINCE THE COLLECTION OCCUPIES ONLY FROM 25-45% OF THE
FLOORSPACE IN LARGE ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, THESE OTHER FACTORS MUST ALSO BE
STUDIED AND REMEDIED IN ORDER TO LIMIT BUILDING GROWTH. THE FOLLOWING MEASURES
TO SLOW THE INCREASE IN STORAGE SPACE ARE REVIEWED IN DETAIL' WEEDING;
ZERO-GROWTH; COMPACT STORAGE; COORDINATED ACQUISITIONS; MINIATURISATION. IN
CONNECTION WITH THE ARRANGEMENT OF STORED MATERIALS, DETAILED ARGUMENTS ARE
CITED WHY BROWSING IS AN INSUFFICIENT RETRIEVAL DEVICE FOR SERIOUS RESEARCH.
THE POINT IS MADE THAT A COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE MEASURES IS NEEDED TO REDUCE
SPACE PRESSURES INHERITED FROM THE PAST. FURTHERMORE, IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF
THE STUDIES SHOWING THAT A HIGH PROPORTION OF ACQUIRED WORKS IS RARELY IF EVER
USED, A MORE LIMITED AND REGIONALLY COORDINATED SELECTION POLICY IS NEEDED TO

A LARGE GAS UTILITY. THEY WERE ASKED TO GIVE PREFERENCE RATINGS TO ALTERNATIVE
ARRANGEMENTS WITH REGARD TO PANELLING, SEATING, BACKGROUND MUSIC, AND THE
LOCATION OF A TERMINAL ON THE DESK. THE MAJORITY OF THE RESPONDENTS PREFERRED
AN OPEN SPACE LAYOUT TO LAYOUTS WITH SOME PANELS, AND SOME BACKGROUND MUSIC TO
NO MUSIC. THESE RESULTS ARE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE FINDINGS OF MOST PAST
STUDIES. AS TO SEATING ARRANGEMENTS, THEY GAVE THE HIGHEST PREFERENCE TO A
RANDOM ARRANGEMENT MADE INDEPENDENT OF THE EMPLOYEE'S SEX OR SENIORITY. WITH
RESPECT TO THE LOCATION OF A TERMINAL, THE LEFTHAND SIDE OF THE OPERATOR WAS
RATED HIGHEST BY ABOUT 1/2 OF THE RESPONDENTS, AND THE CENTRE OF THE DESK BY

THE PHILOSOPHY OF RECORDING KNOWLEDGE.
     
ALTHOUGH MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT HOW MANKIND HAS RECORDED KNOWLEDGE, THE
QUESTION OF WHY RECORD KNOWLEDGE AT ALL HAS NOT BEEN TREATED SYSTEMATICALLY.
INFERENCES AND DEDUCTIONS FROM HISTORICAL RECORDING FORMATS LEAD TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT WHILE TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED THE ART OF RECORD KEEPING, THE
UNDERLYING PURPOSES HAVE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY THE SAME-TO COMMEMORATE,
COMMUNICATE, PRAY, CALCULATE, MEASURE, AND PRESERVE.

OTHER LIBRARIES HAVE SERIOUS GAPS IN THEIR COLLECTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE

SEEM TO BE NO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. SERVICES ARE UNDEVELOPED, BUILDINGS AND
EQUIPMENT ARE NOT OF A HIGH QUALITY, THERE IS NO PLANNED INTERLENDING SYSTEM
OR LIBRARY COORDINATION, AND MOST RESEARCH IS CONCERNED WITH AUTOMATION AND
INFORMATION SYSTEMS RATHER THAN LIBRARIANSHIP. THE CHINESE WISH TO SOLVE THEIR
PROBLEMS THEMSELVES, ALTHOUGH THEY WELCOME HELP. THE WHOLE SITUATION IS IN A

A REVIEW OF THE DEVELOPMENT AND POTENTIAL OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM IN EAST
AFRICA.
     
(MLS DISSERTATION.) TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE HIGH TECHNOLOGY LIBRARY SYSTEM
FAVOURED BY THE WEST IS APPLICABLE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, IT IS NECESSARY TO
STUDY THE HISTORY OF PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT IN A PARTICULAR AREA, ITS

(KENYA, UGANDA, AND TANZANIA) WAS CHOSEN FOR THIS STUDY AS ITS LIBRARY
DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY LONG TO ENABLE A CAUSE-AND-EFFECT ANALYSIS.
IN FUTURE, THERE MUST BE A BALANCE BETWEEN ACCEPTANCE OF APPOSITE WESTERN
IDEAS AND REJECTION OF THOSE IDEAS HARMFUL TO THE COMMUNITY. FINANCIAL SUPPORT

ARE MOBILE LIBRARIES A PROFITABLE MEANS OF PROVIDING LITERATURE FOR
STRUCTURALLY WEAK AREAS?.
     
LITERATURE PROVISION FOR RURAL AREAS HAS ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT. A COMPARISON
BETWEEN MOBILE AND SMALL VILLAGE LIBRARIES SHOWS THAT MOBILE LIBRARIES ARE,
CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION, CHEAPER TO RUN; THEY HAVE LARGER AND MORE
FREQUENTLY CHANGED STOCKS AND DO NOT HAVE TO PAY OVERHEADS FOR HEATING AND
LIGHTING. VILLAGE LIBRARIES CANNOT BE CULTURAL CRYSTALLISATION CENTRES IF
THEIR STOCKS ARE INADEQUATE. CHILDREN ARE THE MAIN USERS OF VILLAGE LIBRARIES,
WHICH THEREFORE STOCK MAINLY CHILDREN'S BOOKS. MOBILE LIBRARIES CARRY A LARGER
PROPORTION OF ADULT MATERIAL; FEWER CHILDREN'S BOOKS ARE NEEDED HERE SINCE THE
CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD SCHOOL LIBRARIES. GOOD QUALITY LITERATURE
PROVISION IS ALWAYS PROFITABLE AND IN CONTRAST WITH VILLAGE LIBRARIES, MOBILE
LIBRARIES ALWAYS HAVE QUALIFIED STAFF. THE TRAVELLING LIBRARY IS A GOOD
ADVERTISEMENT FOR LIBRARY SERVICES.

OF LIBRARY USERS. MUCH PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS IMPOSED TOO RIGID DISTINCTIONS
BETWEEN READERS OF FICTION AND NONFICTION. A MORE RELEVANT DIVISION WOULD BE
ACCORDING TO PROFICIENCY IN DIFFERENT READING SKILLS' CHOOSING BOOKS TO READ;
UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS READ; ACQUIRING AND USING THE INFORMATION CONTAINED. 6
READERSHIP GROUPS DIVIDED BY THESE CRITERIA ARE PROPOSED, RANGING FROM USERS
WITH NONE OF THESE SKILLS TO THOSE WITH A HARMONIOUSLY DEVELOPED RANGE OF
SKILLS.

A PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL BASIS FOR CLASSIFYING READERS.
     
IN ORDER TO DEVELOP READING ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, THE LIBRARIAN MUST BE ABLE
TO CATEGORISE HIS READERS. THIS CAN BE DONE BY A PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL METHOD,
CONSIDERING BOTH THE ACTUAL READING ABILITY AND MOTIVES OF THE READER.
'READING ABILITY' SHOULD TAKE ACCOUNT OF' DIRECTION IN READING
(PURPOSIVENESS); ABILITY TO SELECT BOOKS; AND ABILITY TO ABSORB CONCEPTUAL
CONTENT. READERS' MOTIVES ARE DIVIDED INTO' THOSE WHOSE READING IS DIRECTED
TOWARDS DEVELOPING THEIR SOCIAL AND MORAL OUTLOOK; THOSE WHO NEED HELP IN
CHOOSING A CAREER; THOSE WHO READ TO DEVELOP THEIR PERSONALITY; BUT FURTHER
SUB-DIVISIONS MAY ALSO BE WORKED OUT.

THE ADVANCEMENT OF READING AT WORK.
     
THE FACTORY LIBRARY SHOULD PROVIDE LITERATURE FOR ALL STAFF, ESPECIALLY THE
WORKERS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE READING HABITS
OF DIFFERENT SOCIAL GROUPS; WORKERS PROBABLY COMPRISE MORE THAN 1/8 BUT LESS
THEN 1/2 OF A FACTORY LIBRARY'S READERS. THE FACTORY LIBRARY IS THE LIBRARY
MOST LIKELY TO PROMOTE READING AMONG THE WORKING CLASSES. IN FACTORY
LIBRARIES, AS OPPOSED TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES, THERE ARE MORE ADULT READERS THAN
TEENAGE READERS AND MORE MALE READERS THAN FEMALE. MANY PEOPLE CONSIDER THAT
ADULTS NEED TO READ MORE THAN THE YOUNG AND THAT THE WORKERS WHO DO READ, EVEN
IF ONLY LIGHT LITERATURE, WILL HAVE MORE ACTIVE AND COMMUNICATIVE
PERSONALITIES THAN NON-READERS AND MAKE A LARGER CONTRIBUTION TO PRODUCTIVITY.

HIGHER FOR PATENTS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAN FOR A

SELECTED PATENTS SHOWED THAT THESE SELECTED PATENTS, WHICH UNDERLAY
TECHNICALLY IMPORTANT PRODUCTS, WERE MORE THAN TWICE AS FREQUENTLY CITED AS A
RANDOMLY SELECTED SET OF 102 CONTROL PATENTS. THIS FINDING PROVIDES STRONG
EVIDENCE FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PATENT CITATION DATA CAN BE USED IN
TECHNOLOGICAL INDICATORS DEVELOPMENT, AND IN TECHNOLOGICAL POLICY ANALYSIS,

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTING REGIONAL NETWORK SYSTEMS AND BUILDING UP

PROCESSING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LIBRARY COMMITTEE OF THE GERMAN RESEARCH
SOCIETY (DEUTCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT). THEY UNDERLINE HOW NECESSARY AND
URGENT IT IS TO BUILD UP REGIONAL DATA PROCESSING NETWORKS FOR COOPERATIVE
CATALOGUING IN LIBRARIES. REGIONAL NETWORKS PROVIDE THE OPTIMAL MEANS OF
RATIONALISING LIBRARY WORK. THESE NETWORKS SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUCTED IN ALL 11
FEDERAL STATES BUT SHOULD BE BUILT UP ON THE EXISTING 7 LENDING SYSTEM
REGIONS; THEY WOULD ALL BE CONNECTED IN A NATIONAL NETWORK. REGIONAL LIBRARY
CENTRES WOULD FORM THE NATIONAL NETWORK AND WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING GENERAL
TASK AREAS' CATALOGUING AND ACQUISITION, CENTRAL EDITING OF CATALOGUES ETC.,

DO LIBRARIES HAVE POLITICAL DUTIES?.
     
MANY TASKS UNDERTAKEN BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE POLITICAL, NOT BECAUSE THEY
PROMOTE PARTY POLITICS BUT BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE ENLIGHTENMENT AND PLEASURE FOR
EACH INDIVIDUAL IN A FREE DEMOCRACY. CULTURE INVOLVES NOT ONLY BEAUTY BUT ALSO
SOCIAL REALITY. LIBRARIANS MUST HELP ALL HANDICAPPED PEOPLE; GERMANY IS AHEAD
OF FRANCE IN LIBRARY WORK WITH THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED AND PROVISION OF
LIBRARY FACILITIES FOR FOREIGN WORKERS CERTAINLY INVOLVES BOTH CULTURE AND
POLITICS. THE LIBRARIES MUST PROMOTE READING, OR BOOKS MAY BE OUSTED BY
AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA. STOCK SELECTION CRITERIA MUST BE THOSE OF TRUTH AND
OBJECTIVITY; THE LIBRARIAN MUST BE MINDFUL OF ALL VIEWPOINTS, SINCE FREEDOM

THE LEGAL POSITION OF POLYTECHNIC ('FACHHOCHSCHUL-') LIBRARIES AFTER THE NEW
POLYTECHNIC (UNIVERSITY) LAWS.
     
IN 1979 NEW UNIVERSITY LAWS WERE PASSED WHICH AFFECTED POLYTECHNIC
('FACHHOCHSCHUL-') LAWS AND THE LEGAL POSITION OF POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES.
ALTHOUGH POLYTECHNICS DIFFER IN FORM SLIGHTLY FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER WITHIN
WEST GERMANY, THERE ARE SOME GENERAL POINTS IN THE NEW LAWS WHICH INFLUENCE
POLYTECHNIC LIBRARIES IN THE SAME WAY. THE STATUS OF THE LIBRARIES HAS BECOME
MORE PRECISE; THEY ARE RECOGNISED AS CENTRAL WORKING UNITS. THE LIBRARIES NOW
HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS CONCERNING BUDGET EXPENDITURE AND THE
ALLOCATION OF NEW STAFF. THE POLYTECHNIC LIBRARY HAS THUS BECOME AN
INDEPENDENT INSTITUTION WITH ITS OWN DUTIES AND RIGHTS WITHIN THE POLYTECHNIC.
HOWEVER, LIBRARIES STILL DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF ALLOCATIONS FROM THE CENTRAL
POLYTECHNIC BODIES. FINAL DECISIONS ON THE CHOICE OF LITERATURE ACQUISITION
CAN STILL ONLY BE MADE BY THE RELEVANT POLYTECHNIC DEPARTMENT WITH THE LI
BRARY MERELY ACTING IN AN ADVISORY CAPACITY.

EXAMINES THE LIBRARY LITERATURE WHICH DEALS WITH MEASUREMENT OF LIBRARY
EFFECTIVENESS. THIS IS USUALLY MEASURED IN TERMS OF LOAN FIGURES, BUT THIS
METHOD FAILS TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF REFERENCE AND INFORMATION WORK, NOW OF GROWING
IMPORTANCE. EFFECTIVENESS MUST BE SEEN IN RELATION TO THE LIBRARY'S AIMS. A
MANUAL FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS PUBLISHED IN 1976 BY
THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION. FOR THOSE LIBRARIES WHICH ACTIVELY PROMOTE
MATERIALS TO CREATE DEMANDS, HAMBURG ET AL (1972) SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING TESTS
FOR EFFECTIVENESS' EXPOSURE COUNTS, ITEM USE-DAYS, EXPOSURE TIME. GORE (1978)
USES THE HOLDINGS RATE, AVAILABILITY RATE, AND PERFORMANCE RATE, THE LATTER
MEASURING THE PERCENTAGE OF REQUIRED MATERIAL AVAILABLE WHEN WANTED BY USER.
IT HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THAT BECAUSE EFFECTIVENESS IS A COMPOSITE CONCEPT ITS
MEASUREMENT IS COMPLEX, BUT THAT RELYING ON LOAN FIGURES ONLY IS NO LONGER
NECESSARY.

SAVE! THAT MEANS AGAIN FEWER BOOKS.
     
THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE HAS EXAMINED PUBLIC LIBRARY ACCOUNTS FOR 1981. THESE
SHOW AN OVERALL INCREASE WELL WITHIN THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR'S LIMIT OF 2% REAL
GROWTH. BECAUSE OF BOOK PRICE RISES, ACQUISITIONS ARE LIKELY TO SHOW AN
OVERALL FALL OF 4%. THE SAVINGS CIRCULAR URGED LIBRARIES TO SPEND NOT MORE
THAN 185 KR. PER INHABITANT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT EFFECT THIS
STATEMENT HAS HAD, BUT A CLOSER EXAMINATION SHOWS THAT THE HIGHEST SPENDERS,
ALL IN THE COPENHAGEN AREA, HAVE CUT DOWN MOST. IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY

THE LIBRARY AND THE NEED FOR LIBRARIANS AND TEACHING FACULTY TO BECOME
INVOLVED IN PREPARING THESE FUTURE BUSINESS LEADERS TO DO LIBRARY-CENTRED
RESEARCH. A SURVEY OF 120 ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY USEFUL
AND EFFECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHIC INSTRUCTION METHODS. NEARLY 50% OF THE RESPONDENTS
FELT THAT TEACHING LIBRARY USE IN CONNECTION WITH A REGULAR COURSE IN THE
CURRICULUM WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF LIBRARY INSTRUCTION. OF THOSE
RESPONDING, 88% OF THE LIBRARIES ARE USING THIS METHOD.

COMPETENCY-BASED EDUCATION AND LIBRARY INSTRUCTION.
     
CONTRIBUTION TO A THEMATIC ISSUE ON LIBRARY USE INSTRUCTION. EXPLAINS BRIEFLY
THE MEANING OF COMPETENCY-BASED EDUCATION-AN EDUCATIONAL APPROACH WHICH
STRUCTURES LEARNING AROUND COMPETENCIES DEFINED AS FUNDAMENTAL FOR SUCCESSFUL
PERFORMANCE, AND APPLIES THE CONCEPT TO LIBRARY USER EDUCATION. DISCUSSES THE
EXPERIENCES OF THE FOLLOWING US EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN
COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAMMES' ALVERNO COLLEGE; DOANE COLLEGE; SANGAMON STATE
UNIVERSITY; THE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE; FINDLAY COLLEGE; AND THE UNIVERSITY
OF WISCONSIN-PARKSIDE. IDENTIFIES SOME OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT CAN BE
DERIVED FROM ADOPTING THE COMPETENCY BASED APPROACH TO LIBRARY INSTRUCTION,
BUT RECOGNISES ITS LIMITATIONS, AND POINTS OUT THAT IT MAY BE UNSUITABLE FOR
SOME INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE IT IS TOO TIME CONSUMING AND DEMANDING.

IMPROVING USER TRAINING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.
     
THE AIM OF USER TRAINING IS TO DEVELOP THE ABILITY OF THE USER TO MAKE FULL
USE OF LIBRARY STOCK AND FACILITIES. THE USER MUST UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLES
OF THE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS USED IN THE PUBLIC AND TRADE UNION LIBRARIES. A
GROUP CALLED LIBRARY WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE EXAMINED THE WAY IN WHICH A
BROCHURE INTRODUCING YOUNG PEOPLE TO LIBRARY USE WAS BEING USED IN PRACTICE.
MORE YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN USER TRAINING THROUGH INCREASED
COOPERATION WITH TEACHERS AT TRAINING COLLEGES AND INSTRUCTORS OF APPRENTICES.
USER TRAINING SESSIONS SHOULD BE PLANNED TO INVOLVE YOUNG PEOPLE ACTIVELY,
TAKING THEIR SPECIAL INTERESTS INTO CONSIDERATION. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT
LIBRARY STAFF SHOULD KEEP ABREAST OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN USER TRAINING
METHODS AND EXCHANGE INFORMATION WITH OTHER LIBRARIES IN THE DISTRICT.

UNSTABLE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS, INCORRECT LIGHTING, DUST, BIOLOGICAL CAUSES
(MICRO-ORGANISMS AND INSECTS) AND CHEMICAL CAUSES (OXIDATION AND HYDROLYSIS OF
THE CELLULOSE). TO PROTECT ORIGINAL MATERIAL, COPIES SHOULD BE LENT TO THE
USER WHENEVER POSSIBLE. RESTORATION SHOULD ONLY BE CARRIED OUT WHEN IT IS
UNAVOIDABLE. EVERY STEP OF THE RESTORATION PROCESS SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED AS
LIBRARIANS SHOULD REALISE THAT EVEN EXPERT RESTORATION CAN LEAD TO

FINAL REPORT OF THE PRECIS/TRANSLINGUAL PROJECT.
     
THE FEASIBILITY OF PROVIDING PRECIS WITH EXTRA FACILITIES TO ENABLE IT TO
FUNCTION AS A SYSTEM FOR SWITCHING INDEXING DATA BETWEEN 2 OR MORE NATURAL
LANGUAGES WAS INVESTIGATED. LEXICONS WERE ESTABLISHED IN 3 LANGUAGES, AND A
'PIVOT FILE' CREATED TO LINK THEM. ROUTINES FOR SWITCHING INDEXING TERMS OUT
OF A GIVEN SOURCE LANGUAGE AND INTO A CHOSEN TARGET LANGUAGE WERE DEVISED AND
SET DOWN IN THE FORM OF FLOW-CHARTS OR ALGORITHMS. USING THESE ALGORITHMS,
PRECIS STRINGS WERE SWITCHED MAINLY BETWEEN ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND GERMAN.
PROBLEMS OF TRANSLATION WERE SOLVED BY THE USE OF 'LEXICAL BLOCKS' AND THE
ADOPTION OF A SYSTEM OF CATEGORIES. MECHANISMS FOR THE AUTOMATIC PROVISION OF
ARTICLES IN FRENCH AND GERMAN STRINGS WERE DESIGNED. 2 METHODS OF PROVIDING
INFLECTED FORMS OF NOUNS BY ALGORITHM WERE TESTED IN GERMAN AND POLISH. THE
USE OF 'SUBSTITUTE' PHRASES IN PRECIS WAS INVESTIGATED, AND PROCEDURES FOR THE
AUTOMATIC PROVISION AND CONSTRUCTION OF PHRASES IN A TARGET LANGUAGE WERE
DEVISED. ALGORITHMS DESIGNED TO BUILD PREPOSITIONAL OR ADJECTIVAL PHRASES WERE
TESTED ON ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND GERMAN PRECIS STRINGS.

AND LIBRARIANS, AND ALSO ANNUAL ACQUISITIONS PER HEAD OF POPULATION, ARE
CONCERNED, BULGARIA LIES IN THE 7TH AND 4TH PLACES RESPECTIVELY IN THE WORLD.
HOWEVER, BULGARIA TAKES THE 14TH AND 19TH PLACES IN LOANS AND IN TURNOVER OF
CURRENT BOOK COLLECTIONS. THUS, HIGHER EFFICIENCY REQUIRED IN ALL FIELDS OF
THE NATION'S LIFE BY THE RECENT 12TH CONGRESS OF THE BULGARIAN COMMUNIST PARTY
MUST ALSO BE AIMED FOR IN LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION CENTRES. GREAT ATTENTION
MUST BE PAID IN PARTICULAR TO SCIENTIFIC AND OTHER SPECIAL LIBRARIES WHICH
NEED TO COPE NOT ONLY WITH THE PRESENT INFORMATION EXPLOSION, BUT ALSO WITH
SOARING PRICES OF WESTERN PUBLICATIONS AND BULGARIA'S LIMITED FOREIGN CURRENCY
RESOURCES. AMONGST OTHER PROBLEMS ARE THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF
LIBRARIANS, THE NEEDS IN NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS, MECHANISATION, AUTOMATION, AND
UPDATING OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT. THE CYRIL AND METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY, NOT
ONLY AS KEEPER OF THE NATIONAL LITERARY HERITAGE, BUT ALSO AS THE MOST
IMPORTANT LIBRARY AND INFORMATION CENTRE IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY, IS, IN ITSELF,
A SPECIAL CASE. IT SHOULD BE RELIEVED OF SOME OF ITS PROBLEMS ON THE OCCASION

TO MERIT MORE ATTENTION, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN'S LITERATURE, POPULAR LITERATURE,

ESSENTIAL); PRACTICAL TRAINING (SHOULD PROBABLY BE EXTENDED); EVALUATION OF

THIS ONE-SIDED PRAXIS-WORSHIP.
     
A NORWEGIAN STATE LIBRARY SCHOOL STUDENT REBUTS 3 CLAIMS MADE BY PREVIOUS
WRITERS (SPECIAL SECTION ON LIBRARY EDUCATION IN NORWAY, 2IBID1 46 (8) 1979;
2SEE1 81/60)' (1) THAT LECTURERS HAVE TOO LITTLE PRACTICAL LIBRARY EXPERIENCE
(&H HAVE EXTENSIVE LIBRARY EXPERIENCE, WHILE THE OTHERS MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH
CURRENT LIBRARY PRACTICE); (2) THAT THE COURSE CONTAINS TOO LITTLE PRACTICAL
TRAINING (THE NEW 3-YEAR THEORETICAL CURRICULUM IS A STEP FORWARD. INTERNAL
AND EXTERNAL PRACTICAL WORK, THOUGH STILL NECESSARY, ARE OF LIMITED VALUE IN A
CONSTANTLY DEVELOPING NATIONAL LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE SCHOOL'S PRIMARY TASK IS TO
EDUCATE INDEPENDENT, CRITICAL LIBRARIANS WHO CAN EVALUATE THEIR ROLE IN A
SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE AND BE OPEN TO DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE); AND (3) THAT
INSTRUCTION IS TOO THEORETICAL (ON THE CONTRARY, THERE IS A TENDENCY TO
OVER-VALUE DILIGENCE AND HARD WORK, VIEWING LIBRARIANSHIP AS A SERVICE
INDUSTRY RATHER THAN A SCHOLARLY DISCIPLINE). A MORE LIBRARY /SOCIOLOGICAL-
AND PROJECT-ORIENTED CURRICULUM IS NEEDED, CALLING FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF
COMMITMENT FROM BOTH STUDENTS AND LECTURERS.

NATIONAL LIBRARIAN. DANISH RESEARCH LIBRARIES ARE NOT GIVEN THE SUPPORT FROM
THE STATE IN THE ECONOMIC CRISIS WHICH THEY RECEIVE IN SWEDEN. HE EXPRESSED
FEARS THAT THE PROPOSED LIBRARY ACT, FAR FROM CREATING UNITY WITHIN THE DANISH
LIBRARY SERVICE, WOULD EMPHASISE THE DIVISION BETWEEN RESEARCH LIBRARIES UNDER

THE CULTURAL MINISTER WOULD NOT BE UNDULY INFLUENCED BY THE DANISH LIBRARY

INSTEAD OF ATTACKING THEM FOR LACK OF OPENNESS TO THE PUBLIC THE MINISTER
SHOULD SEE THAT ECONOMIC BARRIERS TO THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE REMOVED.

LIBRARIAN. THE LIBRARY IS CENTRALLY PLACED, HAS A TOTAL OF 1614 SQ.M. ON 3
FLOORS AND EMPLOYS 36 STAFF. WITH A POPULATION OF 45,000, NAESTVED NOW NEEDS A

GENERAL LENDING SECTION, THE MUSIC LIBRARY, WHICH LENDS RECORDS AND TAPES, AND
THE CHILDREN'S LIBRARY; MOST OF THESE WERE SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES. CUTS
HAVE NOT AFFECTED ACQUISITIONS AS MUCH AS FEARED, BUT SERVICES SUCH AS THE
HOME LOAN SERVICE TO THE ELDERLY AND THE MOBILE LIBRARY SERVICES ARE
OVERSTRETCHED, AND SPACE FOR MEETINGS AND ARRANGEMENTS IS INADEQUATE. FILMS
ARE SHOWN IN THE LOCAL CINEMA.

ARE NOT VERY ELABORATE, WITH TEXT IN LATIN ONLY. FROM THE 16TH CENTURY,
PARALLEL TEXT IN GERMAN AND/OR FRENCH WAS ADDED. UP TO THE 18TH CENTURY, THE
MAPS WERE PRINTED AND PUBLISHED MAINLY IN AMSTERDAM, ROME, AUSBURG AND
NUERBURG, BULGARIA'S OWN CARTOGRAPHIC FACILITIES STARTED WITH THE FIRST MAP
PRODUCED BY A BULGARIAN IN BULGARIAN WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN 1843. EVEN THEN,
HOWEVER, MAPS WERE PRINTED IN VIENNA. ANOTHER STEP FORWARD WAS THE LIBERATION
FROM TURKISH RULE (1878), FOLLOWED BY THE FOUNDATION OF VARIOUS NATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS, HEADED BY THE STATE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL INSTITUTE (1891) AND
THE UNIVERSITY OF SOFIA (1898) WITH THE CHAIR OF GEOGRAPHY . THERE WERE ALSO

LIBRARIES IN A SOCIETY OF PICTORIAL ABUNDANCE' DO THEY HONOUR THEIR
RESPONSIBILITY?.
     
PAPER GIVEN AT THE SWEDISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL MEETING. DESCRIBES
TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE VIDEO FIELD, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO LEAD TO AN
ABUNDANCE OF PICTURES COMPETING ON OUR TV SCREENS. THIS SITUATION HAS BOTH
PROBLEMS AND POSSIBILITIES. THE OUTPUT OF VIDEO CASSETTES CONSISTS MAINLY OF
LOW QUALITY ACTION FILMS AND THE DELAY IN THE PLANS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF
SWEDISH TV PROGRAMMES, WHICH SHOULD HEIGHTEN THE QUALITY, IS REGRETTABLE. BUT
THE NEW DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ALSO OFFERS NEW FREEDOM OF CHOICE AND INDEPENDENCE
OF TRANSMISSION TIMES. VIDEO TECHNIQUES ARE USEFUL FOR MINORITIES SUCH AS THE
DEAF AND IMMIGRANTS. THE VIDEOGRAM COMMISSION THEREFORE RECOMMENDS THAT
LIBRARIES SHOULD SHOW VIDEO FILMS, LEND THEM AND TRANSMIT THEM VIA CABLE.

FROM THE STATE FILM CENTRE. REFERS TO VARIOUS REPORTS WHICH MAKE IT CLEAR THAT
VIDEO IS A MATERIAL WHICH PROPERLY BELONGS IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY AND CAN BE
ACQUIRED WITH PUBLIC MONEY. THE DESIRABILITY OF HAVING RADIO AND TV PROGRAMMES
AVAILABLE FOR LOAN IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAS OFTEN BEEN POINTED OUT, BUT THIS
WOULD NECESSITATE CHANGES IN THE COPYRIGHT ACT OR DIRECT NEGOTIATION BY THE
LIBRARIES WITH THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS. ARCHIVES FOR RADIO AND TV PRODUCTIONS

MATERIAL. COOPERATION WITHIN THE NORDIC COUNCIL IS URGED, AND EXPERIMENTS IN

INCREASE, AND BY GOVERNMENTS WILLING TO REDUCE IMPORT PROFIT RATES OF

TOWARDS AN ALTERNATIVE REGIONAL APPROACH TO LIBRARIES.
     
IN THE NETHERLANDS A CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT POLICY TOWARDS THE PROVISION OF
REGIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES IS NOW BECOMING APPARENT. IN THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW
THE INCREASING AVAILABILITY OF ON-LINE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES WILL
NECESSITATE THE CREATION OF A NETWORK OF WELL-STOCKED LIBRARIES IN EACH
REGION. IN ORDER TO FINANCE SUCH A POLICY WHILST LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE
SUFFERING SEVERE ECONOMIC RESTRAINTS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUGGESTED THAT LESS
ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE RECREATIONAL FUNCTION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IN
ADDITION, RESEARCH BY THE BIBLIOTHEEKRAAD (LIBRARY ADVISORY COUNCIL) INTO
INTERLIBRARY LENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS HAS SHOWN THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT
COOPERATION ON ACQUISITION POLICIES AMONGST THE LIBRARIES OF EACH REGION. IN

GRANTS VITAL IN OPERATING A SATISFACTORY LIBRARY SERVICE ACCORDING TO THE

LIBRARY SERVICE DEVOLVES ENTIRELY ON LOCAL AUTHORITIES, THE NORWEGIAN PUBLIC
LIBRARY SYSTEM WILL BE THREATENED BY DISINTEGRATION, WITH NATIONAL LIBRARY
DUTIES CONCENTRATED IN A FEW STATE-OWNED SPECIAL LIBRARIES. SINCE EVEN THE
REVISED LIBRARY ACT OF 1971 DID NOT OBLIGE COUNTIES TO OPERATE A LIBRARY
SERVICE, THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND DEVELOPED LARGELY THROUGH THE
INFLUENCE AND SUPPORT OF CENTRAL AUTHORITY. THE BASIS FOR THE 1971 ACT WAS THE

STANDARDS. UNDER THE NEW PROPOSALS, LIBRARIES IN THE MOST DEPRIVED AREAS WOULD

LIBRARIES AND COMPUTERS.
     
THE DEBATE ON COMPUTERS IN LIBRARIES CENTRES AROUND 2 QUESTIONS' WHETHER
COMPUTERS ON THE WHOLE ARE OF BENEFIT TO USERS, AND WHETHER THE BUMS SYSTEM IN

DEHUMANISED, AND READERS USE MACHINES DIRECTLY WITH MINIMAL HELP FROM STAFF.
SOME SKILLS ARE LOST AND REPLACED WITH ROUTINES. AS FOR THE BUMS SYSTEM, SOME
ROUTINES HAVE MERELY REPLACED OTHERS. A TRADITIONAL CARD CATALOGUE IS EASIER
TO USE THAN THE BUMS CATALOGUE, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER MAKES SURVEY OF THE
LIBRARY'S TOTAL STOCK POSSIBLE. BUT THIS LEADS IN TURN TO INCREASE IN THE
NUMBER OF REQUESTS WITHIN THE LIBRARY SYSTEM; IT FAVOURS THE ACTIVE,

HOW TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE READERS' WORK IN THE LIBRARY.
     
AN IMPORTANT TASK OF THE 5-YEAR-PLAN IS TO SAVE READERS' EXPENDITURE OF EFFORT
IN USING LIBRARIES. COMPUTERISED CATALOGUES SHOW WIDE POTENTIAL. READERS'
REQUESTS ARE TRANSMITTED TO LARGE LIBRARIES' BOOKSTORES ALONG T.V.
COMMUNICATION CHANNELS. DOCUMENT REPRODUCTION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESSENED
READERS' EXPENDITURE OF EFFORT. AUTOMATION OF ACQUISITIONING, CATALOGUING,
INTERLIBRARY LOANS, SELECTIVE RETRIEVAL ALSO SAVE READERS' TIME. LARGE
LIBRARIES HAVE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FOR ISSUING BIBLIOGRAPHIES, ABSTRACTS, UNION
CATALOGUES. LARGE INFORMATION-COMPUTER CENTRES WILL BE CREATED FOR COLLECTIVE

THE IMPORTANCE OF COOPERATION FOR THE UTILISATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL LITERATURE.
     
HUNGARIAN NON-INDUSTRIAL PHARMACEUTICAL INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT PROVIDED WITH
SPECIAL LITERATURE. THEIR LIBRARIES AND BOOK COLLECTIONS BELONG TO THE MEDICAL
LIBRARY NETWORK, BUT THEY ARE THE 'STEPCHILDREN' OF THE NETWORK, AND DO NOT
UTILISE ADVANTAGES TO BE EXPECTED FROM COOPERATION. CONDITIONS IN BUDAPEST ARE
MORE FAVOURABLE THAN ELSEWHERE IN HUNGARY, AS PHARMACISTS CAN VISIT THE
NETWORK CENTRES, THE HUNGARIAN TECHNICAL LIBRARY AND THE LIBRARY OF THE
HUNGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. ELSEWHERE, PHARMACISTS CAN ONLY RELY ON A SMALL
AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE LITERATURE. RECOMMENDS IMPROVEMENTS IN ACQUISITIONS, AND
INTERLIBRARY LOANS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARY COOPERATION, AND
DISCUSSES A DATA BANK ESTABLISHED BY THE HUNGARIAN NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF
PHARMACEUTICS, WHICH HOLDS INFORMATION ON FOREIGN DRUG COMPOUNDS, THEIR
PRODUCERS, INDICATIONS AND COUNTERINDICATIONS, SIDE-EFFECTS, AND POSSIBLE

FILM-SHOWS AND LIBRARIES.
     
FOLLOWING A REQUEST BY HORDALAND COUNTY LIBRARY, DELEGATES FROM THE NORWEGIAN
STATE FILM CENTRE, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MUNICIPAL CINEMATOGRAPHERS, AND
THE STATE LIBRARY OFFICE DISCUSSED FILM-SHOWS AS PART OF LIBRARY SERVICE.
LIBRARIES, LIKE LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND CULTURAL COMMITTEES, CAN OBTAIN
PERMISSION FOR FILM-SHOWS, CERTAIN SHORT OR INFORMATIONAL FILMS BEING EXEMPT.
COOPERATION BETWEEN LIBRARY AND AUTHORITY MAY INCLUDE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION,
JOINT SHOWS FOR PRESCHOOL CHILDREN, USE OF FILM IN FURTHER EDUCATION, AND
SHOWING OF FILMS AND VIDEOTAPES IN LIBRARIES. GOOD CHILDREN'S FILMS ARE IDEAL
FOR LIBRARY SHOWING AND CAN BE LINKED WITH BOOKS. NOT ALL LIBRARY PREMISES ARE
SUITABLE FOR FILM-SHOWS; THIS FACTOR SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN PLANNING NEW

LOMBARDY' THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SYSTEM FOR COLLECTIVE CATALOGUING AND
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION.
     
DISCUSSES THE REASONS BEHIND THE SUSPENSION OF THE PROJECTED NETWORK IN
LOMBARDY, BEGUN IN 1975 AND DISRUPTED IN 1977. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE
STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM DRAWN UP BY THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION, THE
ORGANISATION AND OPERATION OF EXISTING LIBRARIES AS INFORMATION AND
CATALOGUING CENTRES, AND THE TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT INTRODUCED. WITH THE CHANGE
OF GOVERNMENT IN 1977, THE PROJECT WAS SUSPENDED FOR RE-EVALUATION, AND UP TO
1980 NO DECISION HAD BEEN REACHED. THE INHERENT DEFECTS OF THE SYSTEM ARE
ANALYSED, TO SHOW HOW THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION MADE A FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN
ESTABLISHING A DECENTRALISED SYSTEM WITHOUT OVERHAULING EXISTING SERVICES TO
ENSURE ADEQUATE COOPERATION BETWEEN CATALOGUING CENTRES. THE IMMEDIATE CAUSES
OF SUSPENSION WERE INCOMPATABILITY OF THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM CHOSEN WITH MARC,
AND FAILURE OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES TO MAINTAIN ROUTINE CATALOGUING
ACTIVITIES. EMPH ASISES THE NECESSITY FOR BASIC REORGANISATION OF NATIONAL
LIBRARY SERVICES PRIOR TO SCHEMES FOR AUTOMATION AND COOPERATION.

HAS BEEN NEGLECTED. HOWEVER, SINCE IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THIS INTRODUCTION
SAYS EVERYTHING WHICH CAN BE SAID ABOUT LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION IT IS
CONSIDERED THAT IT SHOULD NOT NOW BE FORGOTTEN. HOWEVER THE FAILURE TO RELATE
THE THEORY IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE ACTUAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE SUBJECTS
WITHIN THE SCHEDULES SET THE UNFORTUNATE PATTERN BY WHICH LIBRARY
CLASSIFICATION CAME TO BE DISCUSSED WITH LITTLE OR NO REFERENCE TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER INVOLVED. THE FACT THAT DEWEY SURVIVES AS THE MOST WIDELY USED

TELETEXT SYSTEMS ARE APPROACHING WITH CAUTION.
     
COMMENTS ON THE REPORT BY THE TELETEXT COMMITTEE, SET UP IN 1978 BY THE PRIME
MINISTER'S OFFICE TO EXAMINE WHETHER THERE WAS ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR
INTRODUCING 1 OR MORE TELETEXT SYSTEMS IN DENMARK AND TO EVALUATE THE COSTS
INVOLVED. THE REPORT RECOMMENDS THE INTRODUCTION OF TEXT-TV, WHICH IS REGARDED
AS A USEFUL AND CHEAP MEANS OF TEXTING TV PROGRAMMES AND DISTRIBUTING GENERAL
INFORMATION. TELEDATA'S DIRECT CONNECTION TO DATA BASES WITH UNLIMITED
INFORMATION MAKES IT ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR INFORMATION SEARCHES. IT CAN ALSO
BE USED BY LIBRARIES FOR LOCATION OF BOOKS, LOAN INFORMATION, AND READERS'

IN THE SHADOW OF THE BLACK KRONE.
     
REPORTS ON THE SWEDISH LIBRARY ASSOCIATION'S ANNUAL MEETING IN KIRUNA, JUNE
81. LIBRARIES WERE ACCUSED OF FIXATING ON LOAN FIGURES AND NEGLECTING QUALITY.
PROTESTS AGAINST CUTS IN LIBRARY EXPENDITURE AND CALLS FOR A LIBRARY LAW HAVE
COME FROM PUBLISHERS, AUTHORS AND TRADE UNIONS, AS WELL AS LIBRARIANS. BUT THE
PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION'S REMIT DOES NOT INCLUDE PROPOSALS FOR A LAW, NOR
MAY IT RECOMMEND ACTION WHICH INVOLVES FURTHER EXPENDITURE. IT IS FOREMOST AN
EXAMINATION OF THE STATUS QUO. IT HOPES TO DRAW ON THE FINDINGS OF THE DALA
PROJECT, A LITERATURE CAMPAIGN STARTING IN AUTUMN 81. AN ACCOUNT OF THE
VIDEOGRAM COMMISSION'S WORK WAS GIVEN; STRESS WAS LAID ON THE POSITIVE ASPECTS
OF VIDEO, SUCH AS GREATER AVAILABILITY OF RARE AND UNPOPULAR FILMS AND AIDS
FOR MINORITIES. A DISTRIBUTION NETWORK FOR SERIOUS VIDEO PRODUCTION INVOLVING
LIBRARIES WAS CALLED FOR. A RESOLUTION AGAINST THE INTRODUCTION OF LENDING
FEES AND FOR A LIBRARY LAW WAS REJECTED AS UNANI MITY AMONG REPRESENTATIVES

ROLE OF SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES IN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM.
     
IN THE 1980S, BULGARIAN LIBRARIES MUST MEET THE COMMUNIST PARTY REQUIREMENTS
TO BECOME IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS NOT ONLY TO THE COUNTRY'S TECHNOLOGICAL
PROGRESS BUT ALSO TO THE POPULATION'S AESTHETIC EDUCATION. TO BECOME EQUAL
PARTNERS IN THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM, SCIENTIFIC LIBRARIES HAVE TO
REASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR, AND THE MEANS OF IMPLEMENTING LIBRARY COOPERATION
AND COORDINATION IN RESPECT OF BUILDING UP THEIR BOOK COLLECTIONS. ACQUISITION
OF PUBLICATIONS AND PERIODICALS FROM THE CAPITALIST COUNTRIES MUST, IN
PARTICULAR, BE PLANNED VERY CAREFULLY CONSIDERING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY
RESOURCES. ON THE OTHER HAND, LIBRARIES MUST CONSIDER AS THE 1ST AND FOREMOST
DUTY THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE USSR
AND OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES FROM WHICH PUBLICATIONS ARE FREELY AVAILABLE.
INTERLIBRARY LENDING MUST BE BACKED UP AND EXPEDITED BY EFFICIENT TELEX AND
PHOTOCOPYING SERVICES. WELL-KEPT B IBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES NOT ONLY HAVE
INFORMATION VALUE BUT THEY ALSO HELP IN ATTRACTING NEW READERS.

CENSORSHIP, THEN AND NOW.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 41ST CONFERENCE OF THE GRADUATE LIBRARY SCHOOL,
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, 16-17 MAY 80, CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO SERVICES AND
MATERIALS IN SCHOOL AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THOUGH SOME LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERS
BELIEVE CENSORSHIP IS A RECENT PHENOMENON, IT HAS BEEN A PART OF LIBRARIANS'
LIVES FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY. INDEED, MANY LATE-19TH CENTURY LIBRARIANS
REGARDED THEMSELVES PRIMARILY AS CENSORS, DUTY-BOUND TO PROTECT THE YOUNG FROM
SHODDY AND PERNICIOUS BOOKS, ESPECIALLY FICTION. SOME LIBRARIANS AND TEACHERS
TODAY CARRY ON THIS CENSORIAL TRADITION BY CIRCULATING OR TEACHING ONLY WORKS
OF HIGH LITERARY MERIT OR THE PROPER MORAL CONTENT. THOSE CENSORING ON
LITERARY GROUNDS OFTEN PROVIDE ONLY SUBJECTIVE CRITERIA, JUSTIFYING CENSORSHIP
BY THEIR OWN PERSONAL TASTES. THOSE CENSORING ON MORAL GROUNDS OFTEN PROVIDE
NO BETTER CRITERIA, JUSTIFYING CENSORSHIP BY THEIR OWN PERSONAL MORALITY. LIBR
ARIANS AND TEACHERS HAVE NO RIGHT TO IMPOSE PERSONAL LITERARY OR MORAL
STANDARDS ON THE PUBLIC, YOUNG OR OLD. THEY HAVE A DUTY TO PROVIDE MATERIALS
OF ALL SORTS TO ALLOW CLIENTS AND STUDENTS TO SEARCH THROUGH AND SEEK OUT

IN BERLIN THE LIBRARY SCHOOL IS NOW COMPLETELY INTEGRATED INTO THE UNIVERSITY

STILL MUCH TO BE DONE TO ATTRACT SCIENTISTS AND OTHER EXPERTS WHO HAVE BEEN
AVOIDING LIBRARIES SO FAR. PERSONAL RAPPORT WITH SUCH PEOPLE IS DECISIVE AND
LIBRARIANS SHOULD DRAW IDEAS FROM INSTRUCTIVE PUBLICATIONS ISSUED FOR THIS

INSTEAD LIBRARIES, GIVING IN TO POPULAR DEMAND, CONTAIN A SURFEIT OF MEDIOCRE
AUTHORS. LOCAL FREEDOM TO SELECT IS LARGELY AN ILLUSION AS IN PRACTICE THE
BINDING CENTRE'S REVIEWS ARE HEAVILY RELIED UPON. THE POPULARITY OF
SOCIOLOGICAL AND WOMEN'S NOVELS SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED ENTIRELY, HOWEVER, AS
LIBRARIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CATER BOTH FOR QUALITY AND TOPICALITY. AUTHORS
OF SCHOOL AND CHILDREN'S BOOKS, ON THE ONE HAND, AND OF ADULT BOOKS, ON THE
OTHER, SHOULD HAVE THEIR LIBRARY FEES ASSESSED SEPARATELY. THE WORK OF
CHILDREN'S LIBRARIANS IS EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL AND THEIR TRAINING SHOULD
REFLECT THIS; LITERARY QUALITY HARDLY APPLIES TO CHILDREN'S LITERATURE.

THE SCHOOL LIBRARY IN THE LANDSHUT MUNICIPAL LIBRARY SYSTEM.
     
THE LANDSHUT LIBRARY SYSTEM COMPRISES 3 PUBLIC LIBRARIES WHICH ARE ALSO SCHOOL
LIBRARIES, 1 HOSPITAL LIBRARY AND 9 SCHOOL LIBRARIES, ALL ADMINISTERED BY A
CENTRAL LIBRARY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL PURCHASING AND PROCESSING. THE NEEDS OF
8,000 PUPILS ARE CATERED FOR IN 12 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, 1 SPECIAL
SCHOOL, 2 VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS AND 2 COLLEGES OF FURTHER EDUCATION. 123 CLASSES
VISIT THE LIBRARIES WEEKLY AND SPECIAL HELP IS GIVEN TO FOREIGN CHILDREN. AIMS
FOR THE FUTURE INCLUDE INCREASING STOCKS IN ALL LIBRARIES TO 10 BOOKS PER
PUPIL, PROVIDING MORE SPACE AND STOCK FOR OLDER PUPILS, INCORPORATING
TEACHERS' LIBRARIES INTO THE SCHOOL LIBRARIES AND MAKING WORK IN THE LIBRARY
AN INTEGRAL PART OF SCHOOL CURRICULA.

WORKPLACE LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY' MUTUAL COMPETITION FOR THE BEST LOAN
STATISTICS.
     
AFTER THE 2ND WORLD WAR, WEST GERMANY CONTINUED AS IT LEFT OFF IN 1933, WITH
FACTORY LIBRARIES IN THE OLD PATRIARCHAL FORM AND LIBRARY POLICIES WITH
TRADITIONAL BOURGEOIS IDEALS. IN EAST GERMANY, HOWEVER, A PERIOD OF
DENAZIFICATION AND REBUILDING OF SOCIETY IN A SOCIALIST FORM FOLLOWED THE WAR.
LIBRARIES RECEIVED HIGH PRIORITY IN THE ANTI-FASCIST PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN, WITH
ACCESS TO LIBRARIES IN 96% OF DISTRICTS IN 1957 COMPARED TO 40% IN 1947. A
PURGE OF LIBRARY BOOKS WAS CARRIED OUT ON STALINIST PRINCIPLES WITH SOME
LIBRARIES LOSING UP TO 90% OF THEIR STOCK. HOWEVER, THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM
EXPANDED RAPIDLY, BUT WITHOUT DEVIATION FROM THE IDEOLOGICAL LINE IN BOOK
SELECTION. A NETWORK OF WORKPLACE LIBRARIES UNDER THE TRADE UNIONS HAS ALSO
BEEN DEVELOPED IN KEEPING WITH THE IMPORTANCE ATTACHED TO LIBRARIES FOR
IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION. THE BASIS FOR THESE LIBRARIES IS THE MAXIM' ALL WORKERS
MUST READ. TH E LIBRARIES MUST REACH A CERTAIN NORM IN LENDING FIGURES AND
CONTROL WITH THE MATERIAL BORROWED IS POSSIBLE. THE WORKPLACE LIBRARIES, FAR
FROM BEING AN EXPRESSION OF WORKING CLASS DEMOCRACY, ARE AN IDEOLOGICAL
INSTRUMENT OF THE TRADE UNION LEADERSHIP DIRECTED AT THE WORKING CLASS.

LIBRARIES. DISCUSSES THE IMPORTANCE OF READING IN RELATION TO THE
PROLIFERATION OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA, FROM THE VIEWPOINTS OF BOTH THE
RECREATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL ADVANTAGES OFFERED. IN THE LIBRARY, THE CHILD
IS FREE TO CHOOSE HIS OWN READING MATERIAL, AND IT IS HERE THAT THE MEDIATION

ANCIENT BULGARIAN MANUSCRIPTS.
     
IN THE COURSE OF BULGARIA'S TURBULENT HISTORY, MUCH OF HER NATIONAL LITERARY
HERITAGE WAS DESTROYED. THERE ARE ALSO NUMEROUS ITEMS WHICH ENRICH THE
COLLECTIONS OF LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS ABROAD. IN SPITE OF THAT THE COLLECTIONS

THE ETHICS OF FURTHER EDUCATION LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
THE LIBRARIAN'S 'CLIENTS' IN THE FURTHER EDUCATION SECTOR ARE IDENTIFIED. HIS
DUTIES TOWARDS THEM AND THE PROBLEMS RAISED BY THEM ARE DISCUSSED, WITH
SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE EDUCATION OF THE 16-19 AGE GROUP. THE NEED FOR THE
LIBRARIAN TO HOLD THEIR DIVERSE AND SOMETIMES CONFLICTING DEMANDS IN BALANCE
IS SEEN AS AN ASPECT OF HIS DUTIES THAT REQUIRES PROFESSIONAL AUTONOMY FOR ITS
SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE. THE NEED FOR A BALANCED USE OF THE FACILITIES,
COVERAGE OF SUBJECT AREAS, PROVISION FOR DIVERGENT VIEWS, AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF
FREE ENQUIRY LEADS TO THE SUGGESTION THAT TREATMENT RATHER THAN IDEAS IS WHAT
THE LIBRARIAN IS BEST QUALIFIED TO ASSESS. PORNOGRAPHY IS DISCUSSED IN
RELATION TO THIS AND OTHER CRITERIA. THE GROWTH OF OPEN LEARNING IS SEEN AS
DEMANDING A POSITIVE TUTORIAL APPROACH. THE NEED FOR MORAL COURAGE IS
AFFIRMED.

LEADERSHIP BY NONADMINISTRATORS IN ACADEMIC LIBRARIES.
     
LEADERSHIP BY THOSE NOT IN POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY IN LIBRARIES HAS USUALLY
BEEN DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF PARTICIPATION IN MANAGEMENT. A NUMBER OF OTHER
MODELS ARE GIVEN' PARTICIPATION AND FEEDBACK MODELS, INCLUDING THE EVALUATION
OF SUPERIORS; MODELS OF CONFRONTATION AND RISK TAKING, INCLUDING ACTION TO
OVERCOME MISMANAGEMENT AND ASSERTION OF EMPLOYEES' RIGHTS; AND MODELS FOR
CHANGE AGENTS, INCLUDING USE OF STAFF ORGANISATIONS, INFORMAL ACTION NETWORKS,
AND RESOURCE EXCHANGE NETWORKS. THE THEORY IS THAT A 'SERVANT LEADERSHIP' BY
LOWER AND MIDDLE LEVEL STAFF MAY PROMOTE SERVICE BY LIBRARIES AND ALSO
INCREASE ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK TO THE STAFF THEMSELVES. THE
ACTION MODELS SHOULD BE TESTED AND RELATED TO A CAREER-STAGE MODEL WHICH
IDENTIFIES POWER AND INFLUENCE BY THOSE WHO ARE NOT MANAGERS.

USER REACTIONS TO PRECIS IN THE BRITISH EDUCATION INDEX.
     
REACTIONS OF USERS TO PRECIS (PRESERVED CONTEXT INDEX SYSTEM) SUBJECT INDEXING
IN BRITISH EDUCATION INDEX WERE STUDIED BY STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AS PART OF A
WIDER SURVEY OF PRECIS USER REACTION IN THE UK. FINDINGS ARE PRESENTED IN
TERMS OF EASE OF USE, EFFECTIVE RETRIEVAL OF CITATIONS, WHETHER TOO MUCH
INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN ENTRIES, THE STRUCTURE OF INDEX ENTRIES AND THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TERMS, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A '1-STAGE' INDEX.
CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT IN A SPECIALISED FIELD LIKE EDUCATION A SOPHISTICATED
INDEXING TECHNIQUE CANNOT OBVIATE THE INDEXER'S SPECIALISED SUBJECT KNOWLEDGE,
BUT THAT THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PRECIS ARE NOT UNDER ATTACK, AND ENTRIES
SHOULD NOT BE FURTHER SIMPLIFIED. A MAJORITY CONSIDERED PRECIS BETTER THAN THE
PUBLICATION'S PREVIOUS INDEXING METHOD.

INTEGRATION OF THESAURI IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE CONTA CONFERENCE, BIELEFELD, 24-27 MAY 81. DISCUSSES
THE OBJECTIVES AND COMPILATION OF THE PROPOSED INTEGRATED THESAURUS OF THE
SOCIAL SCIENCES, WHICH IS INTENDED TO ACT AS A MASTER REFERENCE TOOL, AS AN
AID IN SEARCHING ACROSS DATA BASES, OR A SWITCHING MECHANISM. THE 1ST STEP IN
COMPILATION SHOULD BE THE MERGING OF TERMS TO FORM A DESCRIPTOR BANK. TO
COMPARE THE MERGED TERMS AT THE CONCEPT LEVEL, ANALYSIS IN SUB-FIELDS IS
PROPOSED WITHIN A CLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK, PREFERABLY 1 WITH A FACETED
STRUCTURE, SUCH AS THE 2ND EDITION OF THE 2BLISS BIBLIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATION.
1THE CLASSIFICATION WOULD SERVE AS THE MASTER AGAINST WHICH THE TERMS FROM THE
MERGED INFORMATION LANGUAGES, ARRANGED IN A COMPATIBILITY MATRIX, WOULD BE
COMPARED. THE MASTER CLASSIFICATION WOULD BE MODIFIED DURING INTERACTION WITH
THE MATRIX TERMS, AND EMERGE AS THE INTEGRATED THESAURUS IN A FORMAT SIMILAR

THOUGHTS ON THE USE OF TELETEXT IN LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
TELETEXT (BILDSCHIRMTEXT) WAS 1ST SHOWN TO THE GERMAN PUBLIC BY THE FEDERAL
POSTAL SERVICES IN 1977. A COMPARISON IS MADE BETWEEN TELETEXT, VIDEO TEXT AND
2-WAY CABLE TELEVISION. TELETEXT IS PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN LIBRARIES; THE
EQUIPMENT CAN BE USED DIRECTLY BY READERS AND INFORMATION CAN BE OBTAINED FROM
IT AT ANY TIME. SINCE TELETEXT IS A TEXT MEDIUM FOR THE SPEEDY PROVISION OF
TOPICAL INFORMATION IT PRESENTS NO THREAT TO THE BOOK, A MEDIUM FOR READING.
TELETEXT IS ALSO USEFUL IN LIBRARY REQUEST AND LOAN PROCEDURES AND ITS USE CAN
BE IMPLEMENTED IN STAGES, RESULTING IN THE REDUCTION OF COSTS FOR WORK
PROCEDURES AND INFORMATION PROVISION. TELETEXT CONTAINS FEWER ERRORS THAN
PRINTED MATERIAL.

RELATIVE IMPACT OF PRINT AND DATABASE PRODUCTS ON DATABASE PRODUCER EXPENSES
AND INCOME-TRENDS FOR DATABASE PRODUCER ORGANIZATIONS BASED ON A THIRTEEN YEAR
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS.
     
A 13-YEAR ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCES OF A MAJOR DATA BASE PRODUCER ORGANISATION,
WHICH IS ALSO A PUBLISHER OF ABSTRACTING AND INDEXING PRODUCTS, INDICATES
TRENDS REGARDING THE IMPACT THAT BOTH PRINTED PRODUCTS AND DATA BASE PRODUCTS
HAVE ON THE FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE ORGANISATION. THE QUESTION OF 'MIGRATION'
(FROM PRINTED TO ON-LINE DATA BASE PRODUCTS) AND THE FACT THAT EXPENSES HAVE
INCREASED MORE THAN INCOME ARE DISCUSSED AS THEY RELATE TO THE SURVIVAL OR
GROWTH OF DATA BASE ORGANISATIONS. SINCE THE DATA BASE HAS GONE ON-LINE, THERE
HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE DATA BASE REVENUE, CONNECT HOURS, AND
NUMBERS OF ON-LINE USERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAVE BEEN DECREASES IN THE
NUMBER OF DATA BASE LEASES AND LICENCES, THE NUMBER OF PRINT PRODUCT
SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND THE EXCESS OF INCOME OVER EXPENSES. IN CONSTA NT DOLLARS,
THE COST OF PRODUCING AN ABSTRACT HAS DECREASED, THE SUBSCRIPTION CHARGE FOR
PRINTED PRODUCTS HAS INCREASED ONLY SLIGHTLY, THE LEASE AND LICENSE FEES HAVE
DECREASED, ROYALTY CHARGES HAVE INCREASED, AND HOURLY CONNECT FEES HAVE
REMAINED STEADY (EVEN THOUGH THE SIZE OF THE ON-LINE FILE HAS INCREASED
GREATLY). THE PROBLEM IS THAT OF MAINTAINING A BALANCED FINANCIAL STATUS IN
LIGHT OF INCREASED INCOME FROM ONE CLASS OF PRODUCTS, DECREASED INCOME FROM
ANOTHER CLASS OF PRODUCTS, AND INCREASED COST OF OPERATION. POSSIBLE
APPROACHES TO ENSURE ECONOMIC VIABILITY ARE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF EXPENSES,
EFFICIENCY OF OPERATION, MARKETING, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND PRICING. THE MOST
PROMISING APPROACHES LIE IN THE AREAS OF PRICING AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW
PRODUCTS AND SERVI CES. THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A CONSORTIUM OF DATA
BASE PRODUCERS FOR OFFERING ON-LINE SERVICES IS PROPOSED. THERE APPEARS TO BE
NO ALTERNATIVE TO INCREASING THE PRICES FOR ON-LINE USERS.

WHICH ROUTE FOR ELECTRONIC MAIL?.
     
ELECTRONIC MAIL IS LIKELY TO BECOME A MAJOR BUSINESS APPLICATION OVER THE NEXT
FEW YEARS, BUT THE FORM IT WILL TAKE IS LESS CLEAR. SYSTEMS BASED AROUND
FACSIMILE OR COMMUNICATING WORD PROCESSORS COULD BE POPULAR BECAUSE WHILE
TRANSMITTING LETTERS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS ELECTRONICALLY, THEY REQUIRE FEW
CHANGES TO EXISTING OFFICE PROCEDURES. COMPUTER-BASED MESSAGE SYSTEMS REQUIRE
CHANGES IN USER HABITS, BUT ALSO OFFER ADDITIONAL BENEFITS, E.G. IMPROVED
MANAGERIAL EFFECTIVENESS AND A REDUCTION IN THE TIME SPENT ON CLERICAL TASKS.

COMMITMENTS SHOULD BE THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION ON THE CONTEMPORARY

ARGUED OVER THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PURE LIBRARIANSHIP AND ADMINISTRATION IN
THEIR WORK, WHICH ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN ALLOTTING TASKS TO THE
HIGHEST STAFF GRADES. LIBRARIANS FEEL THEMSELVES TO BE INADEQUATELY
REPRESENTED WHEN QUESTIONS ON UNIVERSITY STAFFING ARISE AND SHOULD STRIVE FOR
BETTER COORDINATION. ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PART OF THE ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE OF
LIBRARIANSHIP AND CLOSE LINKS MUST BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THIS DISCIPLINE AND
THE ACADEMIC LIBRARIAN. ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL DUTIES FOR THE HIGHEST

DO LIBRARIANS FEAR PROFESSIONALISM?.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT THE NATIONAL LIBRARIANS ASSOCIATION-SPONSORED PROGRAMME AT
THE MICHIGAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, 11 OCT 80. ARGUES THAT IN THE USA LIBRARIANS
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THE DISTINCTIVE STATUS OF A PROFESSION. THEY HAVE
NO WAY OF MAKING THE CLAIM STICK THAT THEY HAVE CRUCIAL SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE
OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO SOCIETY. AS A RESULT THEY ARE AN OCCUPATIONAL GROUP
UNABLE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING AND PRESTIGE OF
LIBRARIANSHIP THROUGH TRADITIONAL PROFESSIONAL MEANS. BECAUSE OF LIBRARY
ASSOCIATIONS' EMPHASIS ON THE INSTITUTION, THERE IS A LACK OF CONCENTRATION ON
WHAT CONSTITUTES THE PROFESSIONAL BASIS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP; THE ASSOCIATIONS
HAVE CREATED A SITUATION WHERE THE LIBRARIAN HAS OCCUPATIONAL POWER WITHOUT
THE GROWING SOCIAL PROBLEMS OF PROFESSIONAL POWER.

DOCUMENTATION AS A PART OF THE SYLLABUS AT DUTCH LIBRARY SCHOOLS.
     
THE TERM 'DOCUMENTATION' WAS 1ST USED BY PAUL OTLET OF THE INSTITUT
INTERNATIONAL DE BIBLIOGRAPHIE IN 1905. OTLET REGARDED 'BIBLIOGRAPHY' AS TOO

AUTOMATED SYSTEMS IN LIBRARIES IN THE 1960S USE OF THE TERM 'DOCUMENTATION'
HAS BECOME MORE FREQUENTLY APPLIED TO CERTAIN TASKS IN ALL TYPES OF LIBRARIES.

AN ACTIVE FACTOR IN THE PROGRESS/DEVELOPMENT OF THE BULGARIAN NATION.
     
WHEN INTERVIEWED ABOUT ACHIEVEMENTS, PRIORITIES AND PROBLEMS OF THE CYRIL AND
METHODIUS NATIONAL LIBRARY IN SOFIA, ITS DIRECTOR EMPHASISES THE IMPORTANCE OF
INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH BOOKS, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY, FOR THE COUNTRY'S PROGRESS. ALTHOUGH THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF A
SMALL COUNTRY LIKE BULGARIA ARE ALMOST THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE LARGE COUNTRY,
THE FORMER MUST BE MUCH MORE SELECTIVE AND CAREFULLY BUDGETED BECAUSE OF ITS
LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES IN GENERAL, AND PARTICULARLY IN FOREIGN
CURRENCIES. THE NATIONAL LIBRARY'S BOOK COLLECTION IS IN FACT, OPEN TO THE
WHOLE COUNTRY BY MEANS OF INTERLENDING. IT HAS THE MAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR
PUBLISHING THE BULGARIAN NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY, COMPUTERISATION OF WHICH HAS
GRADUALLY BEEN INTRODUCED. EXTENSION OF THE PRESENT BUILDING, CONSTRUCTION OF
A DEPOSITORY LIBRARY TOGETHER WITH OVERALL NEW INVESTMENT WILL ALLOW THE
LIBRARY TO MEET THE INCR EASING DEMANDS ON ITS SERVICES AND HELP TO MAINTAIN
STANDARDS.

HISTORY OF THE KFAR GIL'ADI LIBRARY-A CASE STUDY OF KIBBUTZ LIBRARIES (IN
HEBREW).
     
TRACES THE DEVELOPMENT OF KFAR GIL'ADI'S LIBRARY, ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT
DEVELOPMENT WAS SIMILAR IN OTHER VETERAN KIBBUTZIM. IT IS BASED MOSTLY ON ORAL
AND WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION-A LENGTHY INTERVIEW WITH HAIM YISRAELI, FOUNDER OF
THE LIBRARY, MINUTES OF KIBBUTZ GENERAL MEETINGS AND WRITTEN REPORTS BY
LIBRARIANS. WHEN YISRAELI ARRIVED IN KFAR GIL'ADI IN 1934 HE FOUND ABOUT 250
BOOKS. TOGETHER WITH HIS WIFE HE VOLUNTARILY ORGANISED THE COLLECTION AND
ENHANCED IT SO THAT IN 1938 IT CONTAINED 10,000 VOLUMES AND BECAME AN
IMPORTANT INSTITUTION IN THE CULTURAL LIFE OF THE KIBBUTZ MEMBERS. TODAY THE
LIBRARY IS NO LONGER A CULTURAL CENTRE AND THE COLLECTION DOES NOT MEET THE
NEEDS OF THE MEMBERS. DISCUSSES WAYS IN WHICH THE LIBRARY COULD ONCE MORE

WHAT'S TO BE DONE? MEASURES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION
AND LITERATURE PROVISION.
     
THE BASIC CONCEPT OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY'S TASKS AND DUTIES IN WEST GERMANY
MUST BE CHANGED; OUTDATED STANDARDS ARE A HINDRANCE. THE CONCEPT SHOULD DEMAND
A FUNDAMENTAL UNITY OF PURPOSE AGREED BETWEEN LOCAL COUNCILLORS AND
ADMINISTRATION AND PROVIDE TASKS FOR THE LIBRARY WITHOUT PEDANTIC EMPHASIS ON
THEORETICAL NICETIES. THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING CAN ASSIST IN
EXPLAINING THE PURPOSES AND FUNCTIONS OF LIBRARIANSHIP TO THE ADMINISTRATION.
LIBRARIES MUST EXPRESS THE NEED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM THROUGH THEIR STAFF
ASSOCIATIONS. CURRENT PLANS FOR LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE REASSESSED.
FEDERAL MINISTRIES AND ADVISORY CENTRES SHOULD BE MORE CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH
LIBRARIES AND MORE USE SHOULD BE MADE OF MASS MEDIA PUBLICITY. SURVEYS SHOULD
BE CARRIED OUT ON LIBRARY USE AND LARGE LIBRARIES SHOULD ASSIST IN THE
FINANCING OF LIBRARY RESEARCH.

HINTER BURG PRIMARY SCHOOL HAS A LIBRARY WITH 5,000 BOOKS AND ALSO RECORDS,
SLIDES, CASSETTES AND EDUCATIONAL FILMS. THERE IS NO QUALIFIED LIBRARIAN, BUT
THE TEACHERS RUN THE LIBRARY WITH REASONABLE SUCCESS. MORE MONEY IS NEEDED FOR
STOCKS, FOR EXPANSION AND BECAUSE BOOKS WEAR OUT QUICKLY. THE CHILDREN ARE TOO
YOUNG TO STUDY INDEPENDENTLY THERE BUT THEY ARE ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED TO USE
BOOKS. ALL CLASSES EXCEPT THE LOWEST HAVE REGULAR WEEKLY INSTRUCTION IN THE
LIBRARY. THERE IS ACTIVE COOPERATION WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY; THE
LIBRARIAN ADVISES ON PURCHASES AND ARRANGES MUSIC AND STORY-TELLING SESSIONS
FOR THE CHILDREN. GOOD CONTACTS WITH PARENTS AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITY HAVE ALSO

WHAT DO STUDENTS READ IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES?.
     
LECTURE GIVEN AT THE JOINT MEETING OF THE STUDY GROUPS ON UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
AND LARGE MUNICIPAL LIBRARIES IN ESSEN, JUNE 81. UNIVERSITY STUDENTS TURN 1ST
TO THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY FOR THE BOOKS THEY NEED BUT THEY ALSO FORM A LARGE
READER GROUP IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF A UNIVERSITY TOWN. RECENT SURVEYS MADE
IN COLOGNE AND BOCHUM REVEAL THAT THE PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS A DOUBLE FUNCTION FOR
STUDENTS, COVERING BOTH GENERAL AND SPECIALISED LITERATURE DEMANDS. THE
STUDENTS SHOW GREAT INTEREST IN SOCIAL SCIENCES AND MATHEMATICS AND THEIR
INTEREST IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EQUALS THAT OF THE REST OF THE GENERAL
PUBLIC. THEY BORROW LESS FICTION THAN OTHER READERS, ALTHOUGH THEY DO USUALLY
DEMAND WORKS OF HIGH LITERARY QUALITY AND THEY ARE ATTRACTED BY BRANCH LIBRARY

HOW DO YOU GET ON WITH THE STUDENTS?.
     
THERE ARE OVER 34,000 STUDENTS AT BONN UNIVERSITY, 60% OF WHOM LIVE IN THE
TOWN, SO THAT THEIR NEEDS MUST BE CATERED FOR BY BONN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
STUDENTS FROM COLOGNE AND AACHEN UNIVERSITIES ALSO MAKE USE OF BONN'S LIBRARY
SERVICES. IF A STUDENT CANNOT FIND THE REQUIRED MATERIAL IN THE UNIVERSITY
LIBRARY HE TURNS TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY FOR HELP. IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY HE
FINDS THE ADVANTAGES OF LONG OPENING HOURS AND OF ALL MEDIA ON OPEN ACCESS. IN
1980 15.73% OF ALL LOANS IN BONN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE MADE TO UNIVERSITY
STUDENTS; THEY USED MAINLY ACADEMIC MATERIAL, ESPECIALLY SOCIOLOGY. THE STATE
PROVIDES 13.1% OF TOTAL LIBRARY FUNDS FOR SPECIALISED MATERIAL.

THE LIBRARY'S ADMINISTRATIVE BODY: CLEAR GUIDELINES NOW!.
     
THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT ENVISAGES CULTURAL COMMITTEES AS ADMINISTERING
LIBRARIES. INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY COMMITTEES MAY SURVIVE, BUT AS EXCEPTIONS AND IN
CONFLICT WITH OFFICIAL POLICY. THE LIBRARY SUB-COMMITTEE IS UNSATISFACTORY. A

ARE COUNTY LIBRARIES THREATENED?.
     
THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT REPORT NOU 1979 PROPOSES THAT FROM 1981 STATE GRANTS
TOWARDS COUNTY ADMINISTRATION SHOULD CEASE, BEING REPLACED BY ADDITIONAL TAX
INCOME. THE INTENTION IS TO SIMPLIFY LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL STRUCTURE AND
INCREASE THE COUNTIES' ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTONOMY.
CONCENTRATING ON TECHNICAL DETAILS, THE REPORT IGNORES THEIR EFFECT ON
PROFESSIONS AND EMPLOYMENT IN THE AREAS CONCERNED. CULTURAL WORK IS DEFINED AS
A VOLUNTARY ACTIVITY FOR COUNTIES, NOT REQUIRING OR MERITING STATE SUPPORT;
LIBRARIES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ALREADY UNDER SOME DEGREE OF STATE SUPERVISION.
STATE SUPPORT HAS BEEN A STIMULUS TO CULTURAL LIFE IN RURAL AREAS, AND ITS
REMOVAL WOULD BE A RETROGRADE STEP. THE PROPOSALS, IF IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT
FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY, COULD
LEAD TO GREATLY VARYING STANDARDS OF LIBRARY SERVICE IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES,
ALSO AFFECTING SCHOOLS AND ADULT EDUCATION. THIS WOULD BE DI RECTLY COUNTER TO

IN THE REAL VALUE OF THAT FOR ACQUISITIONS, TOGETHER WITH A DOUBLING OF
ISSUES. THE COMEMNTS ON LIBRARIES ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE REPORT, BUT CAN

OR LIBRARIES WHERE PROBLEMS HAVE NOT YET ARISEN, AND LIBRARIES WITH
CONSIDERABLE PROBLEMS. ARTS FACULTIES HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN SUBJECTS AND

THE NATURAL SCIENCE FACULTIES, INSTITUTE LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ACQUIRE
BOOKS WHICH WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN BORROWED FROM A RESEARCH LIBRARY; GAPS
ARE APPEARING IN RUNS OF PERIODICALS, AND REFERENCE WORKS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY.

UNPAID VOLUNTEERS AND PROFESSIONALS SIDE BY SIDE.
     
SINCE THE 2ND WORLD WAR THERE HAS BEEN A CLEAR TREND IN THE NETHERLANDS
TOWARDS PROFESSIONALISATION IN THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SERVICES. HOWEVER, IN
THE 1960S A REACTION CHARACTERISED BY THE GROWTH OF SELF-HELP ORGANISATIONS
TOOK PLACE AGAINST THE POST-WAR BUREAUCRATIC SOCIETY. WITH THE SUDDEN CHANGE
IN THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND THE RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE 1970S
PROFESSIONALS EMPLOYED IN THE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL SERVICES CAME TO RESENT THE
USE OF UNPAID VOLUNTEERS AS A THREAT TO THEIR OWN POSITIONS. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH
VOLUNTARY WORKERS IN LIBRARIES MAY LACK PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE THEY ARE OFTEN
MORE SOCIALLY-MOTIVATED THAN THEIR PROFESSIONAL COUNTERPARTS. VOLUNTARY
WORKERS IN LIBRARIES SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN DEMANDING AND USEFUL DUTIES BUT NOT
AT THE EXPENSE OF PAID LIBRARY STAFF.

INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL COOPERATION IN SOCIAL SCIENCE DOCUMENTATION.
     
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION IN SOCIAL SCIENCE DOCUMENTATION (COVERING IN THE
WIDEST SENSE ALL ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE COLLECTION, PROCESSING AND
TRANSFER OF INFORMATION) IS ESSENTIAL, YET THE VERY NATURE OF THE INFORMATION
CREATES OBSTACLES TO COOPERATION. MANY DIFFERENT WAYS OF ESTABLISHING
COOPERATION HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTED AND CONSTANT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AT ALL
LEVELS. ONE OF THE 1ST TASKS FACING THESE CONTEMPLATING COOPERATION IS TO
IMPROVE RECIPROCAL INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE SUBJECTS FOR COOPERATION AND ON THE
MEANS AT THEIR DISPOSAL. THEY SHOULD THEN EXCHANGE MATERIALS, INFORMATION,
IDEAS, AND PROJECTS. IF FURTHER COOPERATION IS PROPOSED, JOINT OBJECTIVES
COULD BE ACHIEVED, NETWORKS ESTABLISHED, AND MOVES TOWARDS INTERNATIONAL

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LABORATORIES, INFORMAL CHANNELS OF TECHNICAL
COMMUNICATION ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT. PROPOSES WAYS IN WHICH RESEARCH AND
DEVELOPMENT MANAGERS CAN MAXIMISE USE OF HUMAN RESOURCES THROUGH MANIPULATION
OF THE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS WITHIN THE ORGANISATION, THROUGH INVESTIGATION
OF THE EXISTING COMMUNICATION/INFORMATION ROLES AS INFORMATION PROCESSING
SYSTEMS. THESE ROLES CONSTITUTE THE TRUE AGENTS OF TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION ,

AND REALITIES, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UK, 22-25 SEPT 81. A PHILOSOPHICAL
DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION ON WORK AND
SOCIETY. SUGGESTS THAT COMMUNICATIVE SOCIETY TENDS TO DEMOCRATISE BECAUSE OF
THE ENORMOUS EXPANSION IN THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
AND A SHIFT IN THE LABOUR FORCE SO THAT INFORMATION OPERATIVES BECOME
DOMINANT. STRESSES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT INPUT INTO MODERN PRODUCTIVE
SYSTEMS IS KNOWLEDGE. PREDICTS THAT BY THE 1990S THE WORLD WILL MOVE INTO AN
ERA OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY.

THE INHOUSE SOLUTION FOR DOCUMENT PROCESSING AND RETRIEVAL BY AXP.
     
WITH IDOR-INHOUSE DOCUMENT ONLINE RETRIEVALSYSTEM-A SELF-SUPPORTING AND
COMPLETE TECHNOLOGY OF DOCUMENT PROCESSING, IS INTRODUCED. THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY
OFFERS THE USUAL CONVENIENCE OF MINICOMPUTERS WITH THE SPEED OF PROCESSING OF
MAINFRAMES. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A SPECIAL
FIRMWARE-PRODUCT, THE AXP-ASSOCIATE CROSSPOINT PROCESSOR. AXP COMPARES THE
CONTENTS OF THE DATA BANK AT TRANSFER-RATES UP TO 1.2 MEGABYTES PER SECOND
WITH 8,192 BYTES OF PARALLEL QUERY TERM MEMORY. THE NORMAL EFFORT OF THE
INPUT-PROCESSING IN THIS SYSTEM BRINGS WITH IT THE ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES OF

THE QUALITY OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION ANALYSIS.
     
A PAPER PRESENTED AT A 1979 BRAZILIAN CONFERENCE. WHILE INFORMATION CONTROL
AND DOCUMENT ACCESS TECHNIQUES HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF
AUTOMATED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY, IT IS ON THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION INPUT THAT THE EFFICIENCY OF
AUTOMATED SYSTEMS DEPENDS. INFORMATION PROCESSING SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO
THE PROCEDURES FOR SYSTEMS ORGANISATION AND ADMINISTRATION, AND LINKED
DIRECTLY TO INFORMATION DISSEMINATION SERVICES. THE CHIEF FACTOR GOVERNING
QUALITY OF SYSTEM INPUT IS INFORMATION ANALYSIS, AND IN BRAZIL THIS IS ALMOST
TOTALLY NEGLECTED.

EXAMINATION OF THE MARKETING IMPLICATIONS FOR INFORMATION PRODUCTS AND
SERVICES.
     
INFORMATION NEEDS THE APPLICATION OF GOOD MARKETING PRINCIPLES IN ORDER TO
HAVE SATISFIED CUSTOMERS AND CREATE A FINANCIALLY SOUND INDUSTRY. INFORMATION
HAS HOWEVER SEVERAL MARKETING PROBLEMS' LACK OF SKILL WITHIN THE INDUSTRY;
ABSENCE OF MARKET RESEARCH; NO DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN SUPPLIER AND USER; POOR
PACKAGING; DIFFICULTIES OF MAINTAINING QUALITY; AND LITTLE APPRECIATION OF
VALUE BY THE CUSTOMER. PROMOTION ACTIVITY OF PERSONAL SELLING, MAILING,
ADVERTISING AND EXHIBITING HAS TO BE PLANNED AND MONITORED.

THE OVERRATED PLB-A FIASCO TO FIX.
     
THE USE OF PUBLIC LIBRARY BINDING (PLB), ADVOCATED FOR CHILDREN'S BOOKS IN THE
EARLY 1950S BY THE ALA ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARY SERVICE TO CHILDREN (THEN
CHILDREN'S SERVICES DIVISION), HAS BEEN A FIASCO. PLBS VARY IN QUALITY AND
SOME LAST NO MORE THAN A FEW CIRCULATIONS. IT IS ESPECIALLY FOOLISH FOR LARGE
LIBRARIES TO BUY ANY PLB THEY DO NOT NEED BECAUSE THEIR 38-40% TRADE DISCOUNTS
MAKE THEM BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE INEQUITABLE PLB NET PRICING SYSTEMS. REVIEWS

COMMENTS ON THE REPORT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES
(KOMMUNERNES LANDSFORENING (KL)) ON THE TRIAL RUN OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES'
AUTOMATION SYSTEM, FAUST, IN OLSTYKKE LIBRARY. GIVES THE REASONS FOR THE
FAILURE OF FAUST AS LACK OF PERCEIVED ECONOMIC RETURNS, OPPOSITION OF THE

PROBLEMS OF CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION IN THEATER LIBRARIANSHIP.
     
PROBLEMS IN CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFYING THEATRE RESOURCES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY
CONTRIBUTED TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THEATRE LIBRARIANSHIP. THE UNSUITABILITY OF
MAJOR EXISTING CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR USE WITH THEATRE COLLECTIONS HAS
PROMPTED LIBRARIANS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS MODIFICATIONS AND ORIGINAL
CLASSIFICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, COLLECTIONS OF NON-BOOK, OR 'FUGITIVE',
THEATRICAL MEMORABILIA ARE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CATALOGUE PROPERLY, GIVEN
THE DESPERATE FINANCIAL SITUATION FACING MANY THEATRE COLLECTIONS. US SURVEY
DATA ON CURRENT PRACTICES INDICATE A STRONG TREND TOWARD STANDARDISATION OF
PROCEDURES IN CLASSIFYING, YET A CONTINUING DIVERSITY IN CATALOGUING METHODS.
THE COMING OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY, ALONG WITH INCREASED AWARENESS AMONG
THEATRE LIBRARIANS AND INPUT FROM CONCERNED PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS, MAY
HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE.

MY WISH IS YOUR COMMAND??.
     
THE INCREASING NUMBER OF DATA BASES AND DATA BANK SUPPLIERS HAS BROUGHT WITH
IT THE PROBLEM THAT DIFFERENT HOST COMPUTERS MUST NORMALLY BE ACCESSED USING
DIFFERENT COMMAND LANGUAGES. MANY OF THESE LANGUAGES BEAR RELATIONSHIPS TO ONE
ANOTHER, BY VIRTUE OF COMMON ANCESTRY, COMMON DESIGN PHILOSOPHY, ETC. EVEN SO,
THE SAME LANGUAGE CAN BE IMPLEMENTED DIFFERENTLY BY 2 SUPPLIERS. DIFFERENT
IMPLEMENTATIONS AND/OR LANGUAGES MUST BE CONSIDERED BY ON-LINE USERS BEFORE
CONTRACTING WITH A HOST. THE CONSEQUENCES OF LEARNING A NEW COMMAND SET,
BUYING ADDITIONAL MANUALS, AND ATTENDING EXTRA COURSES ARE ALL ECONOMIC ONES,

WHY STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES?.
     
THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY THE GROWTH AND SPREAD IN THE USE OF ON-LINE
INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN LESS DRAMATIC THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN
EXPECTED. ONE OF THE OBSTACLES FACING THE USER IS THE NEED TO MASTER MANY
DIVERSE USER INTERFACES. SEVERAL SOLUTIONS ARE OFFERED, YET, THE ONLY ONE
WHICH IS REALLY OPEN AT PRESENT IS TO DECLINE TO USE ALL BUT 1 OR 2 FAMILIAR
SYSTEMS, ACCEPTING THAT SOME POTENTIALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION WILL BE MISSED.
THE MAIN ALTERNATIVES SEEM TO BE THE ADOPTION OF STANDARDS BY SYSTEM OPERATORS
OR THE USE OF TRANSLATING SOFTWARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE USER AND THE
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS. WITH THE ADVENT OF THE MICROPROCESSOR AND THE INTELLIGENT
TERMINAL, THIS LATTER ALTERNATIVE BECOMES MORE ATTRACTIVE AND IT MAY APPEAR,
AT 1ST SIGHT, THAT THE NEED FOR STANDARDS FOR COMMAND LANGUAGES IS THEREFORE
LESSENED, OR EVEN DISAPPEARS TOTALLY. HOWEVER, CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE
POSSIBILITIES OFFERED LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ADOPTI ON OF STANDARDS
WILL BE MORE RATHER THAN LESS IMPORTANT IF MUCH OF THE POTENTIAL IS TO BE
REALISED.

A TERMINAL IN THE TECHNICAL REFERENCE ROOM, WITH ACCESS BY ALL DEPARTMENTS,
BUT NOT THE PUBLIC. IT REGARDS THE ON-LINE SERVICE ONLY AS AN ADDITIONAL
REFERENCE TOOL. NONE OF THE LIBRARIES UNDERTOOK COMPUTER SEARCHES OF THEIR OWN
STOCK, BUT ONLY IN INTERNATIONAL DATA BASES. LIBRARIANS FOUND THAT SEARCH
EFFIC IENCY INCREASED IF USERS WERE INTERVIEWED FIRST, BUT NOT PRESENT DURING
THE ACTUAL SEARCH, AND THAT THOSE CARRYING OUT THE SEARCH SHOULD BE
EXPERIENCED REFERENCE LIBRARIANS SPECIALISING IN A PARTICULAR BASE. RAISES THE
QUESTION OF THE EFFECT ON PUBLICATION OF REFERENCE WORKS IN PAPER EDITIONS OF

NUMERIC DATABASES: TOO MANY OR NOT ENOUGH STATISTICAL DATA?.
     
HISTORICALLY THE 1ST NUMERICAL DATA BASES WERE ORGANISED TO MEET A SPECIFIC
DEMAND BY SUPPLYING ECONOMISTS WITH BASIC STATISTICAL DATA TOGETHER WITH
COMPUTERISED TOOLS IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE THE RETRIEVAL DATA. DATA WERE
GATHERED FROM ANY STANDARD OR READILY-AVAILABLE SOURCE. SOME VERY USABLE DATA
BASES WERE SOLD BY THEIR PRODUCERS TO BE OFFERED TO ON-LINE SEARCHERS. MANY
DATA BASES DISPLAY STRONG SIMILARITIES, OFFERING THE SAME INFORMATION, WHILE
IN OTHER FIELDS, FOR MANY COUNTRIES, INFORMATION IS SCARCE IF AT ALL

SCIENCE.
     
PAPER PRESENTED AT LIBRARY HISTORY SEMINAR VI 'LIBRARIES & CULTURE', AUSTIN,
TEXAS, 19-22 MAR 80. WITH GROWTH COMES COMPLEXITY; AND LIBRARIANSHIP BECOMES
INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AS IT GROWS. A 2-FOLD APPROACH TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF
LIBRARIANSHIP IS SUGGESTED. FIRSTLY, LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A
GENERAL DISCIPLINE AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD BE STUDIED AS A WHOLE, AND
SECONDLY, BASIC COMPONENTS OF LIBRARIANSHIP SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED, BY REDUCING
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE FIELD TO ITS SIMPLEST PARTS-ITS 'ROOTS'. PROPOSES A
MODEL OF 'METALIBRARIANSHIP' BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS, AND INVOLVING ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT ITS NATURE IN TERMS OF THE MECHANISM, EXPANDED CONTEXTUALISM AND
FORMISM, AND SUGGESTING THAT THE PRIMARY ROOT METAPHOR OF METALIBRARIANSHIP IS
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GENERIC BOOK, ITS SUBJECT MATTER, AND ITS READER.

ARCHIVISTS WISHING TO PURSUE THE CONCEPT OF ARCHIVAL THEORY MUST FIRST DEFINE
THAT CONCEPT AND THEN WEIGH THEIR DEFINITION AGAINST THE WORK DONE IN THE
FIELD SO FAR. ONE APPROACH WOULD BE TO CONSIDER THEORY AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF
UNIVERSAL LAWS, AND TO FRAME HYPOTHESES IN UNIVERSAL FORM AND TEST THEM
AGAINST THE EVIDENCE. ADDRESSES THE LIKELY FUTURE TRENDS IN US ARCHIVAL THEORY
AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, CONCLUDING THAT THERE IS HOPE FOR THE PROFESSION IF'
(1) THE PROFESSION ITSELF REALISES THAT IT IS BOTH A SCIENCE AND A CRAFT; AND
(2) CERTAIN ARCHIVISTS MAKE THE MOVE FROM THE WORKPLACE TO THE ACADEMY AS A
PERMANENT CAREER COMMITMENT. THERE THEY MUST REALIGN THEMSELVES WITH ACADEMIC
HISTORIANS AND OTHERS TO PRODUCE A BODY OF BASIC PRINCIPLES, A SYSTEM OF
IMMUTABLE LAWS-A LITANY OF THEORY AND DOGMA.

ON THE PROFESSIONAL ETHICS OF THE LIBRARIAN FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF EDUCATION
AND TRAINING.
     
SOCIALIST LIBRARY SYSTEMS AIM TO IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL OF THE PEOPLE
IN ALL SUBJECTS, TO PROVIDE SOUND COMMUNIST TRAINING AND TO SUPPORT THE
FURTHER GROWTH OF SOCIALIST SOCIETY. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF LIBRARIANS
MUST, THEREFORE, BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE OBJECTIVES. THE LIBRARIAN HAS A
RESPONSIBILITY TO SOCIETY TO PROVIDE FOR THE GROWING DEMAND FOR LITERATURE AND
INFORMATION, TO FURTHER RESEARCH STUDY AND TO SUPPORT SOCIALIST EDUCATION.
WHATEVER BRANCH OF LIBRARY WORK THE STUDENT WILL EVENTUALLY BE INVOLVED IN,
TRAINING SHOULD NOT BE RESTRICTED TO LEARNING FACTS AND LIBRARY METHODOLOGY
TECHNIQUES BUT SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE A FLEXIBLE TRAINING IN THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC
ASPECTS OF LIBRARY WORK. A LIBRARIAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELATE HIS PARTICULAR
SOCIAL ROLE IN HIS BRANCH OF LIBRARY WORK TO THE SOCIALIST LIBRARY SYSTEM AS A
WHOLE.

INTRAMURAL STUDY.
     
THE INTRAMURAL COURSE OF STUDY AT THE HUMBOLDT UNIVERSITY IN BERLIN LEADING TO
A DEGREE IN LIBRARY SCIENCE PROVIDES FUTURE LIBRARIANS WITH SCIENTIFICALLY
BASED KNOWLEDGE AND GOOD PRACTICAL CAREER TRAINING. A STUDENT FOLLOWS COURSES
IN SUBJECTS RELATED TO LIBRARY SCIENCE, MARXISM AND LENINISM, AND FOREIGN
LANGUAGES, RUSSIAN, ENGLISH AND FRENCH. SEVERAL PRACTICAL WORK PERIODS SPENT
IN DIFFERENT PUBLIC AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES MAKE UP PART OF THE COURSE.
LIBRARIAN STUDENTS ALSO ATTEND COURSES IN SUBJECTS SUCH AS INFORMATION
SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND MODERN MEDIA TO ENABLE THEM TO FOLLOW FUTURE
DEVELOPMENTS IN THESE FIELDS AFFECTING THE LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE COURSE OF STUDY
LASTS 8 TERMS, THE LAST OF WHICH IS SPENT IN A LIBRARY DOING PRACTICAL WORK
AND RESEARCHING FOR A THESIS FOR THE FINAL EXAMINATION. THE TITLE AWARDED TO
LIBRARIANS ON PASSING THE FINALS IS DIPLOMBIBLIOTHEKAR (DIPLOMA LIBRARIAN).
THE CO URSE ALSO TRIES TO STIMULATE STUDENTS TO INDEPENDENT STUDY WHILE AT

ON SOME THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF THE SUBJECT BIBLIOGRAPHY WITHIN
THE INTRAMURAL COURSE OF STUDY IN LIBRARY SCIENCE.
     
SUBJECT BIBLIOGRAPHY IS DIVIDED INTO 7 THEMATIC GROUPS' THEORETICAL
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF BIBLIOGRAPHY; ORGANISATION OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
LITERATURE INFORMATION AND METHODS OF BIBLIOGRAPHICAL ACTIVITY; HISTORIC
DEVELOPMENT OF BIBLIOGRAPHY; PRESENT LEVEL OF GENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHY; PRESENT
LEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC BIBLIOGRAPHY; PRESENT LEVEL OF RECOMMENDATORY BIBLIOGRAPHY
IN EAST GERMANY AND USSR; AND THE BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BIBLIOGRAPHY. THESE 7 THEMES
ARE CLOSELY LINKED AND INTERSECT IN MANY AREAS ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE
BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BIBLIOGRAPHY, WHICH OFTEN ACCOMPANIES OTHER THEMES. THE COURSE
IN BIBLIOGRAPHY IS A BALANCED MIXTURE OF THEORY AND PRACTICE. IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT STUDENTS SHOULD BE EDUCATED TO THE ADVANCED LEVEL OF BIBLIOGRAPHY AS IT
EXISTS IN EAST GERMANY AND USSR. THE TIME ALLOTTED TO THE COURSE IS NOT
ADEQUATE AND STUDENTS HAVE TO STUDY INDEPENDEN TLY WHICH REQUIRES A GOOD
KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGES AS MUCH OF THE COURSE LITERATURE IS IN RUSSIAN AND
ENGLISH.

REPORT OF A LECTURE GIVEN TO THE ANNUAL MEETING OF DENMARK'S SCHOOL LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, 1981 BY PETER SEEBERG. THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF SCHOOL AND
PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN DENMARK IS REVIEWED AND DOUBTS ARE CAST ON THE GENUINENESS
OF OFFICIAL DANISH LIBERALISM IN RELATION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AND ATTITUDE
TO LIBRARIES. SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ORIGINATED FROM 2 ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
CONCEPTS' IN SCHOOLS CHILDREN HAD OTHERS TO THINK FOR THEM; LIBRARIES IN
DENMARK AROSE FROM THE LATE 19TH CENTURY IDEA OF CULTURE FOR ALL AND ACCESS
FOR ALL TO EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO KNOW. BY THE 1930S LIBRARIES HAD BECOME
INSTIGATORS OF CULTURE, WITH LECTURES AS WELL AS BOOKS AVAILABLE, AND WERE

PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT.
     
STATISTICS ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY FOR 1976-80 REVEAL INCREASES IN
STOCKS, LOANS AND USERS. IN 1980 STOCKS TOTALLED OVER 36 MILLION ITEMS, LOANS
OVER 79 MILLION AND READERS OVER 3 MILLION. DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SLIGHTLY
SLOWER THAN DURING THE PREVIOUS 5 YEARS, PARTLY BECAUSE A HIGH STANDARD HAD
ALREADY BEEN REACHED AND PARTLY BECAUSE MORE ORGANISATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS WERE
REQUIRED. PLANS FOR STOCK EXPANSION HAVE GONE AHEAD BECAUSE THE STATE
PUBLISHING INDUSTRY'S PRODUCTION FIGURES HAVE INCREASED. THE PLANNED TOTAL
STOCK EXPANSION FIGURE HAS BEEN EXCEEDED AND EFFORTS WERE MADE TO KEEP STOCKS
UP TO DATE. TOTAL LIBRARY EXPENDITURE IN 1980 WAS 111,642,600 M, REFLECTING

FOR GREATER EFFICIENCY OF REGIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES.
     
COMPARED WITH 1939, THERE ARE 4 TIMES AS MANY LIBRARIES IN BULGARIA CATERING
FOR 32 TIMES AS MANY READERS. BOOK COLLECTIONS-ALMOST 83 MILLION VOLUMES AT
PRESENT-HAVE INCREASED 34 TIMES. BULGARIA COMES 5TH IN THE WORLD AS TO THE
NUMBER OF BOOKS PER HEAD OF POPULATION. IN SPITE OF THESE ENCOURAGING
STATISTICS, THE STATE CONTROL COMMITTEE MADE AN INVESTIGATION RECENTLY INTO
THE STRUCTURE, ORGANISATION AND EFFICIENCY OF LIBRARY SERVICES IN 7 REGIONS.
THE AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC, SCHOOL AND TRADE UNION LIBRARIES VARIED GREATLY.
INHABITANTS ON SOME OF THE NEW HOUSING ESTATES HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED UP TO NOW OF
ANY KIND OF LIBRARY SERVICES. THERE WERE CASES OF HAPHAZARD OPENING AND/OR
CLOSING OF LIBRARIES. THERE IS STILL A LACK OF INFORMATION AND REFERENCE
SERVICES, SHORTAGES IN CONSISTENT CATALOGUING AND PROPER UPKEEP OF RARITIES,
RECOVERY OF OVERDUE BOOKS, AS WELL AS INADEQUATE AUDIO-VISUAL AND REPROGRAPHIC
EQUIPMENT. BETTER PLANNING FOR ACQUISITI ONS, AND ALSO MORE CONSIDERATE
DISCARDING OF OBSOLETE ITEMS ARE MOST DESIRABLE. THE COMMITTEE'S FINDINGS WILL
BE PRESENTED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER RELEVANT BODIES WHOSE MEMBERS HAVE
TO TAKE A MUCH MORE ACTIVE INTEREST IN LIBRARIES IN THEIR REGIONS, IN

WHAT AN IMMIGRANT NEEDS IN THE LIBRARY.
     
EXAMINES THE LIBRARY SERVICE TO DENMARK'S 100,000 IMMIGRANTS. THE 'QUEST
WORKER COLLECTION' IN GENTOFTE LIBRARY, SET UP IN 1970, HAS NOT YET SOLVED THE
PROBLEM OF SELECTION OR ACQUISITION OF SUITABLE MATERIAL. BEST RESULTS HAVE
BEEN ACHIEVED WITH ACTIVITIES FOR CHILDREN. MEETINGS BETWEEN LIBRARY STAFF AND
IMMIGRANTS COULD IMPROVE SERVICES. INFORMATION TO THE DANES ABOUT IMMIGRANTS
IS VARIED AND SHOULD BE ACQUIRED BY LIBRARIES. BUT THERE IS A LACK OF MATERIAL
IN DANISH ON THE IMMIGRANTS' HOME BACKGROUND AND COOPERATION IS HAMPERED BY
LACK OF IMMIGRANT LEADERS. THE LIBRARY SCHOOL HAS NOT YET TAKEN THE SUBJECT
UP. 2 REPORTS FROM THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE (1973, 1980) COME UP WITH
PROPOSALS, AND AN ETHIOPIAN BORN LIBRARIAN, I. ABDULLAHI, IN HIS 'DESCRIPTION
OF IMMIGRANTS AND LIBRARIES IN DENMARK' (1981), CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEBATE. HE
LISTS THE INFORMATION FROM LIBRARIES WHICH IMMIGRANTS NEED AND SUGGESTS WAYS
OF IMPROVING SERVICES, SOME OF WHICH NEED MO NEY, OTHERS ONLY IMPROVED
PERSONAL EFFORT AND REORGANISATION OF EXISTING WORK.

LIBRARY WORK IS FOR THE USER' THOUGHTS ON THE EDUCATIONAL CONTENT OF THE
SUBJECT GROUP ON LIBRARY USE.
     
LIBRARIES IN SOCIALIST SOCIETIES ARE CONSCIOUSLY ORIENTED TOWARDS THE USER.
IMPORTANT OBJECTIVES OF LIBRARY WORK CONCERNING LIBRARY USE ARE' THE
CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL NEEDS; DEVELOPMENT OF AN
AWARENESS OF SOCIAL NEEDS; AND PLANNED STIMULATION OF THE NEED FOR NEW
LITERATURE AND INFORMATION. THE SUBJECT GROUP ON LIBRARY USE SUPPLIES STUDENTS
WITH THE NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO USE THE SOCIO-POLITICAL ASPECT OF
ENTIRE LIBRARY ACTIVITY AND ADAPT IT TO MEET THE SOCIAL NEEDS OF THE USER.
LIBRARY USE FALLS UNDER 2 MAIN HEADINGS' USE IN THE LIBRARY ITSELF AND
EXTERNAL USE, THE LENDING SYSTEM. OTHER IMPORTANT FEATURES OF LIBRARY USE ARE'
LIBRARY REGULATIONS FORMING PART OF THE CIVIL LAW; THE LENDING SYSTEM, HOW TO
MAKE IT MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THE USER AND USER EDUCATION COURSES WHICH SHOULD BE
ORGANISED BY LIBRARIES TO IMPROVE THE USERS' KNOWLEDGE OF THE LIBRARY S YSTEM.

WALTER HOFMANN PUBLISHED AS PART 2 OF A PAPER ON LIBRARIES 2ON THE PSYCHOLOGY
OF THE PROLETARIAT (ZUR PSYCHOLOGIE DAS PROLETARIATS) 1IN 1910. HE CARRIED OUT
A GREAT DEAL OF RESEARCH INTO THE TYPES OF LITERATURE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE
READ, WHAT CATEGORIES WORKING CLASS READERS COULD BE DIVIDED INTO AND HOW TO
INFLUENCE AND IMPROVE THEIR READING HABITS. HE ALSO CARRIED OUT AN IMPORTANT
SURVEY ON WOMEN'S READING. RUDOLF ANGERMANN CONTINUED AND EXPANDED HOFMANN'S
WORK. THEY BOTH CONSIDERED THE STIMULI TO READ CERTAIN TYPES OF LITERATURE TO
BE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AND ANGERMANN FORMULATED A LIST OF DIFFERENT READING
STIMULI. THEY WERE BOTH OF THE OPINION THAT THE LIBRARIAN'S TASK WAS TO ACT AS
ADVISER AND INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE LITERATURE AND THE READER. THEIR AIM WAS
TO OFFER GOOD QUALITY LITERATURE TO LARGE SECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE. TODAY
METHODS OF READER RESEARCH CONTINUE TO BE D EVELOPED IN SOCIALIST COUNTRIES
AND AIM TO ACHIEVE AN OPTIMAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ACQUISITION AND USE OF

IN THE NETHERLANDS DESPITE COMPULSORY EDUCATION FOR THE WHOLE POPULATION THERE
ARE NOW SOME 100,000 TO 400,000 (SEMI-)ILLITERATES. IN DUTCH SCHOOLS 2 METHODS
OF LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE HAVE BEEN USED, THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF
LEARNING TO RECOGNISE LISTS OF SIMPLE BUT UNRELATED WORDS AND THE FUNCTIONAL
METHOD WHICH WAS RELATED TO THE PUPIL'S ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE. WHICHEVER
METHOD IS USED, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO DEVELOP THE PUPIL'S ABILITY TO READ
FLUENTLY AND TO MOTIVATE HIM TO CONTINUE READING AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL. THE
DUTCH PUBLIC LIBRARY ACT OF 1975 RECOGNISED THE IMPORTANCE OF LIBRARY SERVICES
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN ABOLISHING LIBRARY MEMBERSHIP CHARGES UP TO THE AGE OF 18.

MORTENSEN, TO THE MEETING OF THE KOMMUNERNES LANDSFORENING (NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES), WHERE THE QUESTION HAD EARLIER BEEN RAISED
OF HOW CULTURE COULD BE DISSEMINATED TO LARGER CIRCLES. IT WAS ARGUED THAT
EXPANSION OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES WAS NOT ENOUGH TO REACH THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH
LIBRARIES. THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK HAD PREVENTED GENUINE DECENTRALISATION
AND POPULARISATION OF CULTURE. LIBRARIES WITH RIGID MANAGEMENT AND DEMAND FOR
QUALIFIED STAFF WERE PREVENTING THEIR USE AS LOCAL CULTURE CENTRES. SOLUTIONS
INVOLVING GREATER COORDINATION WITH OTHER LOCAL ACTIVITIES WERE OFFERED.
AGAINST THIS MORTENSEN ARGUES THAT THE 1964 LIBRARY ACT PROMOTED
DECENTRALISATION AND THAT LIBRARIES MORE THAN OTHER INSTITUTIONS ARE REACHING
THE BROAD POPULATION. WARNS AGAINST REDUCTION OF LIBRARY ACTIVITIES IN ORDER
TO HELP THE GRASS ROOTS MOVEMENTS. LOCAL AUT HORITIES NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE

INTRODUCTORY SPEECH TO THE STUDY SESSION OF THE WORKING PARTY FOR COUNTY
LIBRARY SYSTEMS, NOORDWIJKERHOUT, 1 SEPT 81. IN THE NETHERLANDS, THE RISE IN
LIVING STANDARDS SINCE WORLD WAR II HAS OUTSTRIPPED THE INCREASE IN LEISURE
TIME. IN ADDITION THE AVERAGE CITIZEN DEVOTES A LARGE PROPORTION OF HIS
INCREASED PURCHASING POWER TO ACQUIRING PRIVATE COMFORTS. WHEREAS BEFORE THE
WAR MOST PEOPLE VISITED THE CINEMA OR THEATRE FOR ENTERTAINMENT, AND TRAVELLED
BY BUS OR TRAIN, NOWADAYS THEY WATCH TELEVISION AT HOME AND TRAVEL BY PRIVATE
CAR. SIMILARLY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN USES THE LIBRARY NOT AS
A SUBSTITUTE FOR A PRIVATE COLLECTION OF BOOKS BUT TO SUPPLEMENT HIS OWN
COLLECTION. AS THE ECONOMIC RECESSION DEEPENS THERE IS A REAL DANGER THAT THE
GOVERNMENT WILL TURN PUBLIC LIBRARIES INTO RECREATIONAL CENTRES AND CREATE NEW
LIBRARIES AS INFORMATION CENTRES.

IN THE 1978/79 ACADEMIC YEAR STUDENTS OF THE FREDERIK MULLER SCHOOL OF
LIBRARIANSHIP CARRIED OUT A SURVEY INTO CENSORSHIP IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE
NETHERLANDS. 15 LIBRARIES, VARYING IN SIZE FROM SMALL TOWN TO LARGE CITY
LIBRARIES, WERE SELECTED, 5 IN AREAS WITH A STRONG PROTESTANT LEANING, 5 IN
ROMAN CATHOLIC AREAS AND 5 IN AREAS WITH NO STRONG RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS. THE
RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF CONTROVERSIAL BOOKS STOCKED BY LIBRARIES WAS
IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE SIZE OF THE LIBRARY. IN ADDITION, DESPITE THE
ASSURANCES OF ALL LIBRARIANS THAT NO FORM OF CENSORSHIP WAS PRACTISED, FEWER
BOOKS OF A POLITICALLY-CONTROVERSIAL OR PORNOGRAPHIC NATURE WERE TO BE FOUND
IN LIBRARIES IN RELIGIOUS AREAS. IT IS CLEAR THAT CENSORSHIP IS STILL ALIVE IN
THE NETHERLANDS IN 1981 UNDER THE GUISE OF 'REJECTION ON ETHICAL GROUNDS'.

PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS A COMPULSORY PROVISION BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
     
AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE POSITION OF LOCAL AUTHORITY
CULTURAL SERVICES MUST BE CLARIFIED IN THE 1980S. THE LIBRARY SERVICE IS A
PART OF LOCAL CULTURE THAT CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED AND SO IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR
EACH LIBRARY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER LIBRARIES, CULTURAL ORGANISATIONS AND
LOCAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATORS. A DECISION IS NEEDED AS TO WHETHER LOCAL
AUTHORITIES ARE NOT ONLY ENTITLED BUT ALSO OBLIGED TO ADMINISTER PUBLIC
LIBRARIES. THE CONCEPT OF A NATIONAL LIBRARY LAW SHOULD BE RENOUNCED IN FAVOUR
OF A CONCEPT WHEREBY LOCAL AUTHORITIES IMPOSE ON THEMSELVES THE OBLIGATION TO
PROVIDE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. LOCAL COMMUNITIES SHOULD DRAW UP THEIR OWN LIBRARY
PLANS AND PROVIDE THE MONEY; EACH STATE SHOULD THEN PROVIDE FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE FOR LIBRARY WORK OUTSIDE THESE AREAS.

BEFORE. RECENT SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN THAT ABOUT 40% OF THE POPULATION ARE LIBRARY
USERS. WHERE POSSIBLE, ECONOMIES SHOULD BE MADE IN WORKING METHODS RATHER THAN
IN SERVICES; THIS DEMANDS MORE CENTRALISATION. IT IS BETTER TO PUT BOOKS IN

IT IS USELESS TO ECONOMISE WHEN MONEY IS IN SHORT SUPPLY.
     
THE GERMAN ECONOMY IS ADAPTING WITH DIFFICULTY TO THE RECESSION, TO THE
DETRIMENT OF PUBLIC BUDGETS. CULTURE IS IMPORTANT DURING ECONOMIC CRISES,
THEREFORE CULTURAL BODIES CANNOT RENEGE ON THEIR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES.
THRIFT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE MOST ECONOMIC PROCEDURE. AN ANALYSIS IS MADE OF
STATISTICS ON LIBRARY EXPENDITURE BY LARGE AND SMALL LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN WEST
GERMANY IN 1975-79 TO ILLUSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
STAFFING COSTS AND THE TOTAL BUDGET. A CAREFUL LIBRARY POLICY MUST RECOGNISE
THE POSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF ADAPTING TO THE FINANCIAL SITUATION IN
THE LIGHT OF ITS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IF RATIONALISATION METHODS ARE
CARRIED OUT EFFICIENTLY, THE LIBRARY SERVICE CAN ADAPT IN THE RIGHT WAY.

WHEN THE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED IN 1956, AS AN ASSOCIATION OF PARISH
LIBRARIANS, THE POSITION AS PART-TIME LIBRARIAN WAS USUALLY HONORARY AND
UNPAID, A FACT WHICH CAUSED LACK OF ESTEEM FOR THE JOB. THERE WAS LITTLE
INTEREST IN MEMBERSHIP AND THE ASSOCIATION HAD TO BE FINANCIALLY SUPPORTED BY

BEEN MET FROM THE LIBRARIANS' ASSOCIATION AND LATER THE LIBRARIANS' UNION,
UNNECESSARILY, AS THE PART-TIME LIBRARIANS ON THE WHOLE RECOGNISE THE ULTIMATE
GOAL OF FULL-TIME LIBRARIES STAFFED BY PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS, BUT INSIST ON
SATISFACTORY TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THERE SHOULD BE A CHANCE FOR PART-TIME
LIBRARIANS THROUGH SUPPLEMENTARY COURSES TO QUALIFY AS LIBRARIANS, AND IT IS

THE ARCHITECT'S VIEW OF MULTI-PURPOSE PLANS.
     
USING LIBRARIES AND SCHOOLS FOR OTHER PURPOSES OUTSIDE OPENING HOURS IS A
NATURAL AND GOOD CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR DEVELOPING LIAISON WITH OTHER CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES. THE TRADITION OF CHARGING AT MOST A NOMINAL RENT IS LESS
DEFENSIBLE. EXTRA USE INVOLVES UPKEEP AND STAFFING COSTS, AND ORGANISATIONS
MAY RENT UNSUITABLE PREMISES FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. THE DISTRICT CENTRE AT
LYNGEN, NORWAY, HOUSING A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANISATIONS AND A POTENTIAL EXAMPLE
OF INTEGRATED ACTIVITY, HAS TO CHARGE A RENT UNACCEPTABLE TO SMALLER GROUPS.
FOR EFFECTIVE USE, ALL CULTURAL PREMISES SHOULD HAVE THE SAME FINANCIAL
STANDING AND JOINT ADMINISTRATION. IN PLANNING OR CONVERSION, THE NEEDS OF
INDIVIDUAL USERS SHOULD BE ANALYSED AND COORDINATED. THE LIBRARIAN, FOR
INSTANCE, SHOULD BE ABLE TO RENT CERTAIN AREAS FULL-TIME (E.G. THE NECESSARY
SPACE FOR STORING EQUIPMENT, SHELVING AND BOOKS) AND OTHER AREAS FOR THE
LIBRARY'S ACTUAL OPENING HOURS, OUTSIDE WHICH THEY COULD BE USED  BY OTHER

APPLYING H.A. SIMON'S MODEL OF LIMITED RATIONALITY TO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND
COMMUNICATION.
     
A GREAT NUMBER OF SPECIALIST AND NON-SPECIALIST QUESTIONS ARE ASKED ABOUT
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, CONCERNING OBJECTIVES, METHODS, RESULTS, ORGANISATION,
POLICIES AND INFORMATION SOURCES. SUCH QUESTIONS CAN BE COLLECTED AND ANALYSED
FOR COMMON DENOMINATORS BUT RECENT WORK BY ANDREWS AND HIS COLLABORATORS
(1979) INDICATES THIS APPROACH TO BE INADEQUATE. USES SIMON'S CONCEPT OF
LIMITED RATIONALITY AS A GENERAL MODEL OF INDIVIDUAL AND ORGANISATIONAL
OPERATION, WHICH IS APPLIED AS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTIGATING
RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. THE MODEL DOES HELP IN EXPLANATION OF OBSERVATIONS
FREQUENTLY MADE ABOUT RESEARCH BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS' PREFERENCE FOR INFORMAL
INFORMATION SOURCES AND PERSONAL CONTACTS, AND THE FORMATION OF INFORMAL
GROUPS AND NETWORKS. RESEARCHERS AND THEIR ORGANISATIONS WOULD APPEAR TO
FUNCTION WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF LIMITED RATIONALITY. THIS MODEL CAN ALSO BE
USED TO PREDICT POTE NTIAL PROBLEMS IN SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION, SUCH AS THE
CONCEPTION AND USE OF THESAURI AND DATA BANKS. THE QUALITY OF SUCH INFORMATION
SOURCES IS CRUCIAL TO THE FUTURE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, HENCE THE IMPORTANCE
OF UNDERSTANDING RESEARCH BEHAVIOUR.

REMARKS ON THE PRE-PRINT OF RAK-WB.
     
THE RAK-WB (REGELN FUR DIE ALPHABETISCHE KATALOGISIERUNG IN
'WISSENSCHAFTLICHEN BIBLIOTHEKEN')-RULES FOR ALPHABETICAL CATALOGUING IN
RESEARCH LIBRARIES-HAVE BEEN COMPILED TO CORRESPOND TO THE SPECIFIC SITUATION
IN RESEARCH LIBRARIES AND FULFIL THEIR PURPOSE WHICH IS TO BRIDGE THE TIME GAP
UNTIL RAK IS PUBLISHED IN BOOK FORM. RAK-WB PROVIDES A BASIS FOR CATALOGUING
IN RESEARCH LIBRARIES DEMONSTRATING THE DESIRED UNIFORMITY IN ALL IMPORTANT
POINTS. ITS USE WILL LEAD TO UNIFORM PROCESSING AT ALL STAGES OF
CLASSIFICATION WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR COOPERATIVE CATALOGUING AND DATA
EXCHANGE. ITS VALUE IS INCREASED BY THE MANY AMENDMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS WHICH
WENT INTO ITS MAKE-UP AS A RESULT OF YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE WITH RAK.
RAK-WB HAS BEEN QUICKLY ADOPTED BY THE RAPIDLY EXPANDING LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS.
IT IS HOPED THAT THE PLANNED RAK-OB FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES WILL BE OF A
COMPARABLE STANDARD.

USER PERCEPTION OF DATA IMPORTANCE AND THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF HARDWARE

RETRIEVAL SYSTEM'S FUNCTIONS ARE ULTIMATELY DICTATED BY DATA BASE DESIGN.
EARLY ON-LINE SYSTEMS WERE DESIGNED FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION LIMITED TO
CITATIONS ONLY USING SEQUENTIAL FILES. NOW FULL TEXT INFORMATION, NUMERIC
INFORMATION, AND MANIPULATIVE SYSTEMS ARE BEING PERCEIVED BY A CLASS OF USERS
NOT INTERESTED IN SPECIALISED VOCABULARY SKILLS. THESE USERS ARE PLACING
DEMANDS THAT WILL REQUIRE SOPHISTICATED INTERNAL TECHNOLOGY, IMPROVED AND
EXPANDED STORAGE CAPABILITY, MORE SOPHISTICATED FILE STRUCTURE, AND
TRANSPARENT DATA MANIPULATIVE DEVICES. THE ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF THESE DEMANDS
WILL BRING ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW GENERATION OF MULTITIERED DATA BASES
THAT ALLOW USERS AT ALL SKILL LEVELS TO APPROACH THEM. THE POINT IS THAT, AS
THE USER'S NEED FOR TYPES OF DATA TO BE RETRIEVED CHANGES, SO MUST THE DATA
BASE TECHNOLOGY CHANGE. REPORT NOT AVAILABLE FROM NTIS.

EMBODIED IN THE REVISION COMMITTEE'S REPORT ON PROPOSED CHANGES IN THAT PART

FREE COPYING IN SINGLE COPIES FOR PRIVATE USE, BUT TO RESTRICT PROFESSIONAL
MULTIPLE COPYING. THIS RESTRICTION IS PARTICULARLY AIMED AT THE NEW MEDIA'
SOUND AND VIDEOTAPES, WHICH HAVE LED TO MASS USE. THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE RIGHTS OF COPYRIGHT HOLDERS TO ECONOMIC PROFIT FROM THEIR
WORKS AND THE RIGHT OF SOCIETY TO FREE ENJOYMENT OF CULTURAL VALUES. UPHOLDS
THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF THE OWNER'S SOLE RIGHT, BUT POINTS TO WAYS OF SOLVING
COPYRIGHT CONFLICTS IN A MASS USE SITUATION VIA LICENCE AGREEMENTS. TODAY,
WHERE TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE COLLECTIVE EXPLOITATION OF WORKS OF ART POSSIBLE IT
IS NATURAL TO SEEK THESE AGREEMENTS WITH ORGANISATIONS RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL
ARTISTS. RECOMMENDS THAT SUCH LICENCE AGREEMENTS BE CONCL UDED, AND THAT

SURVEYED, ACRL ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY 7 JOURNALS READ ON A
REGULAR BASIS. A SEPARATE ANALYSIS OF THE 1978 DATA INDICATED THAT 7 OF THE
TITLES CITED AS BEING READ ACCOUNTED FOR 80% OF THE JOURNAL READING. AS HAD
BEEN THE CASE IN 1973, MORE THAN 9 IN 10 OF THESE ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS WERE
REGULAR READERS OF COLLEGE & RESEARCH LIBRAR IES. HOWEVER, SEVERAL OTHER
TITLES HEAVILY CITED IN 1973 LOST READERSHIP AMONG ACRL MEMBERS DUE TO THE
DRAMATIC APPEARANCE OF THE JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP.

ARCHIVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN THE UNITED STATES, 1937 TO PRESENT.
     
FROM ALMOST ITS INCEPTION IN 1937, ARCHIVAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING HAS BEEN
PRIMARILY A POST-EMPLOYMENT EFFORT. THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE INDIFFERENCE OF
THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS IN BOTH THE FIELDS OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND HISTORY,
THE 2 MAIN DISCIPLINES FROM WHICH MANUSCRIPT LIBRARIANS AND ARCHIVISTS ARE
DRAWN. BETWEEN 1937-40 AND 1967-70, THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION BECAME
PERIPHERALLY INTERESTED. THE HISTORY PROFESSION HAS BECOME MORE ACTIVE SINCE
THE EARLY 1970S IN ITS SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE CAREERS FOR ASPIRING HISTORIANS.
INDIVIDUAL LIBRARY SCHOOLS ALSO HAVE BEEN OFFERING ARCHIVAL MANAGEMENT COURSES
SINCE THE EARLY 1960S PARTICULARLY. BY LACKING ACADEMIC STATUS, THE AMERICAN
LITERATURE IN THE ARCHIVAL FIELD HAS ALSO BEEN UNDERDEVELOPED, AND THIS HAS
CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLOWNESS IN DEVELOPING ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL CONTROL OF

OSLO, WITH 456,000 INHABITANTS, ENJOYS A PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE FROM 2 MAIN
CENTRES-THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY (UBO) AND THE DEICHMANSKE BIBLIOTEKET. THE UBO
SERVES BOTH AS A UNIVERSITY AND NATIONAL LIBRARY, THEREBY CREATING A SERIES OF
DIFFICULTIES IN THE STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION OF THE SERVICE. BIBLIOGRAPHIC WORK
HAS BEEN FACILITATED BY THE USE OF COMPUTERS, AND NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL
BIBLIOGRAPHIES ARE IN PROCESS. THE PUBLIC HAS A SINGLE ALPHABETICAL AUTHOR AND
SUBJECT CATALOGUE, AND BUREAUCRATIC FORMALITIES HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO A
MINIMUM. THE DEICHMANSKE IS DISTINGUISHED FROM OTHER SCANDINAVIAN LIBRARIES BY
ITS WIDESPREAD SERVICE TO SCHOOLS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES. IT AIMS TO
PROCURE AND LEND BOOKS UNOBTAINABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. BOTH LIBRARIES LEAVE

DISCUSSES THE ROLE OF THE LIBRARY IN ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS AS
PRESCRIBED BY BRAZILIAN STATE LEGISLATION, AND SUGGESTS CLOSER INTEGRATION OF
SCHOOL AND LIBRARY TASKS. DETAILS ARE GIVEN OF THE STRUCTURE OF SCHOOL
ORGANISATION, WHICH ASSIGNS THE LIBRARY TO THE CATEGORY OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT
FOR TEACHING PROGRAMMES AND DESIGNATES IT AN EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITY.
CRITICISES THIS AS AN INADEQUATE CONCEPTION OF THE LIBRARY'S ROLE, AND ARGUES
FOR ACTIVE COLLABORATION IN THE TEACHING PROCESS, AS A BACK-UP MULTI-MEDIA
RESOURCE CENTRE. EXAMINES THE OFFICIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE LIBRARY, AND SHOWS HOW
INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED FOR THE FULFILMENT OF EVEN ITS NOMINAL
TASKS. IN CONCLUSION A RESTRUCTURING OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS PROPOSED,
PERMITTING TOTAL INTEGRATION OF LIBRARY AND TEACHING PROGRAMMES AT ALL LEVELS.

THE TEACHER AND THE MEDIA CENTRE-PROBLEMS AND DISTURBANCES IN USE.
     
THE FUNCTIONS AND ORGANISATION OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES/MEDIA CENTRES AS
INDISPENSIBLE PREREQUISITES FOR THE REALISATION OF EDUCATIONAL AIMS HAVE BEEN
DISCUSSED SINCE THE 1970S, BUT LIBRARIANS' HIGH EXPECTATIONS HAVE GENERALLY
NOT BEEN REALISED. EVEN IN COMPREHENSIVE SCHOOLS, MEDIA CENTRES ARE STILL ONLY
ON THE FRINGE OF SCHOOL LIFE. THE USE OF A MEDIA CENTRE AS A FOCAL POINT OF
SCHOOL ACTIVITIES DEMANDS RADICAL CHANGES IN SCHOOL STRUCTURE AND THE
TEACHER'S ROLE. MANY OF THE MEDIA PROVIDED ARE UNSUITED TO THE SCHOOL LEARNING
SITUATION. TEACHERS HAVE TO SPEND MUCH TIME PLANNING THE DEVELOPMENT OF
INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMMES; CLOSE COOPERATION WITH SCHOOL LIBRARIANS WOULD
PROVE HELPFUL HERE. ADMINISTRATION OF CENTRALLY STORED MEDIA IS EFFECTIVE AND
ECONOMICAL BUT SINCE MUCH TIME IS WASTED WHEN CHILDREN MOVE BETWEEN CLASSROOM
AND MEDIA CENTRE, FLEXIBLE TIMETABLES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED.

LESSONS START AT 8 A.M. THE CENTRE CONTAINS BOOKS, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON
PICTORIAL MATERIAL, RECORDS, VIDEO GAMES AND CASSETTES. PUPILS ARE GIVEN
INSTRUCTION ON USING THE CENTRE. THE SCHOOL IS THE REGIONAL CENTRE FOR THE
LOAN OF TEXTBOOK SETS. DANCING AND FILM SESSIONS ARE ALSO HELD IN THE CENTRE

HAS THE DISCUSSION ABOUT SCHOOL LIBRARIES FINISHED?.
     
SINCE THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY, THE VALUE OF A CENTRALLY SITUATED SCHOOL LIBRARY
OPEN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND ENCOURAGING A LIFE-LONG LEARNING PROCESS HAS
BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED. THE DISCUSSION RECEIVED FRESH IMPETUS AFTER 1970 WITH
THE DEVELOPMENT OF USA, UK AND SCANDINAVIAN SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRES AND RENEWED
INTEREST IN THE SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL FUNCTIONS OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
CLASSROOMS MUST BE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THE SCHOOL MEDIA CENTRE; THEIR
EVOLUTION INTO CLASS MEDIA CENTRES HAS ONLY OCCURRED SO FAR IN PRIMARY
SCHOOLS, A CHANGE DEMANDING GOOD ORGANISATION AND CLOSE LINKS WITH THE PUBLIC
LIBRARY SYSTEM. THE TRIANGULAR RELATIONSHIP CLASSROOM-SCHOOL MEDIA
CENTRE-PUBLIC LIBRARY CAN BE EQUATED WITH EMUNDS' '3-TIER' LIBRARY SYSTEM;

PUBLIC LIBRARY NEEDS FOR BLACKS' A PERSONAL VIEW.
     
IN SOUTH AFRICA IT OFTEN IS ALLEGED THAT BLACKS REQUIRE THE PUBLIC LIBRARY TO
OFFER SERVICES BY WHICH THEY CAN ADVANCE THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND CAPABILITIES. ON
THE MASLOW PYRAMID THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED A NEED AT THE BASIC LEVEL, WHILE
THE READING OF RECREATIVE WORKS COULD BE CONSIDERED TO LIE AT A HIGHER LEVEL.
IN FACT IT IS FOUND THAT 72% OF BOOKS BORROWED BY BLACKS CONSIST OF FICTION.
IT MAY NOW BE QUESTIONED WHETHER THE BLACK COMMUNITY HAS ALREADY PASSED THE
BASIC READING LEVEL, OR WHETHER RECREATIONAL READING FORMS PART OF THAT LEVEL.
AS SOME 66% OF THE BLACK MEMBERSHIP OF A LIBRARY MAY CONSIST OF CHILDREN, THE
HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FICTION CIRCULATED RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER THESE
CHILDREN SEE LIBRARIES PRIMARILY AS SOURCES OF INFORMATION, AND ABOUT THE
SUITABILITY OF NON-FICTION PROVIDED. ONLY ABOUT 5% OF BLACKS USE AVAILABLE
LIBRARY FACILITIES. IT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE EDUCATIONAL APPROACH
IS NOT BEING OVER-STRESSED IN BLACK PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

SCIENCES. IT IS DESIRABLE TO SET UP SPECIAL COMMITTEES WHICH HAVE TO FIND WAYS
OF MAXIMISING THE EFFECT OF POLITICAL LITERATURE UPON READERS. RESOLUTE
POLICIES MUST BE PURSUED, STARTING WITH ACQUISITION, WHICH, IN PARTICULAR WITH
RESPECT TO FOREIGN POLITICAL LITERATURE, MUST BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE. CATALOGUING
AND BUILDING UP OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES MUST SATISFY THE READERS' NEEDS IN
SPEEDY CURRENT AWARENESS. EXHIBITIONS ON THE OCCASION OF IMPORTANT POLITICAL
ANNIVERSARIES AND TOPICAL EVENTS, ESTABLISHMENT OF SPECIALISED READING AND
STUDY ROOMS, AND ALSO MORE INTENSE RESEARCH INTO THE USE OF POLITICAL
LITERATURE ARE ONLY A FEW OF THE SUGGESTIONS TO ATTRACT SCIENTISTS TO STUDY
THIS KIND OF LITERATURE PERMANENTLY AND TO BENE FIT BY IT IN THEIR

THE PLACE OF THE NATIONAL LIBRARY IN THE SWEDISH LIBRARY AND INFORMATION

PAPER PRESENTED AT THE 1ST SWEDISH-SOVIET SEMINAR ON 'THE NATIONAL LIBRARY
WITHIN A COUNTY'S LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES' DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS'
HELD IN MOSCOW, 21-22 NOV 78. THE SWEDISH LIBRARY SYSTEM IS DIVIDED INTO 2
SECTIONS-NATIONAL LIBRARIES (SERVING THE GENERAL PUBLIC) AND SPECIAL
(INCLUDING UNIVERSITY, INSTITUTIONAL AND GOVERNMENT LIBRARIES). THE FUNCTION
OF THE SWEDISH NATIONAL LIBRARY IS HELD BY THE ROYAL LIBRARY; THE COORDINATING
ROLE RESTS WITH THE COUNCIL OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES. THE TENDENCY TOWARD
CENTRALISATION RESULTED, IN 1975, IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COUNCIL FOR
INFORMATION SERVICES WITH THE FUNCTION OF CENTRAL COORDINATION AND PLANNING OF
THE NATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM. THE ORGANISATIONAL ROLE IN THIS SPHERE RESTS
WITH THE ROYAL LIBRARY.

RESPONSIBILITY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY.
     
A TALK GIVEN AT A COURSE ON LEADERSHIP-PUBLIC LIBRARIES AT THE LOCAL
AUTHORITIES' HIGH SCHOOL, NOV 81. DISCUSSES POLITICIANS' EXPECTATIONS OF THE
LIBRARY AND ITS STAFF. COOPERATION BETWEEN LOCAL POLITICIANS AND LIBRARIANS IS
OFTEN HAMPERED BY THE LIBRARIANS' PREFERENCE FOR CENTRALLY IMPOSED NORMS
INSTEAD OF ADAPTATION TO LOCAL NEEDS. BUT IMPOSITION OF OBLIGATIONS TAKES AWAY
SPONTANEITY. OBJECTS TO SELF-APPOINTED MORALISTS GUIDING THE PEOPLE'S CULTURAL
NEEDS IN A CERTAIN IDEOLOGICAL DIRECTION. COMPREHENSIVENESS, ONE OF THE
LIBRARY OBJECTIVES, CANNOT BE ON THE BASIS OF A PARTICULAR BOOK, WHICH MUST
NECESSARILY PRESENT A PARTICULAR VIEWPOINT, BUT MUST BE AN OVERALL GUIDELINE.
THE LIBRARY LAW, LIKE MODERN EDUCATION AND SOCIAL LAWS, SHOULD SPECIFY AN
OBLIGATION TO DEVELOPMENT PLANNING IN THE INDIVIDUAL AUTHORITY, NOT LAY DOWN
EXTERNAL STRUCTURAL NORMS WITHOUT REGARD TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. THE LEADING
LIBRARIAN AND THE LEADING HEAD TEACHER MUST HAVE EQUAL  SAY ON THE CULTURAL
COMMITTEE TO SECURE LIBRARIES' INDEPENDENCE FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE LEADER FROM
THE EDUCATION SERVICE. LIBRARIES MUST NOURISH THE QUALIFIED DOUBT AND SUPPLY
THE MEANS FOR CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM OF EXPERT KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY IN THE
DEMOCRATIC DECISION MAKING PROCESS. LIBRARIES AND LOCAL POLITICIANS MUST
COOPERATE IN KEEPING ART AND CULTURE INDEPENDENT OF POLITICAL AND COMMERCIAL
INFLUENCE.

MANAGEMENT-BY-OBJECTIVES APPLIED IN A SOUTH AFRICAN INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY.
     
MANAGEMENT-BY-OBJECTIVES IS SUGGESTED AS A MEANS TO JUSTIFY THE EXISTENCE OF
AN INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICE. THE PREREQUISITES ARE THAT THE
INDUSTRIAL LIBRARIAN MUST GRASP THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A
SERVICE FUNCTION OPERATES IN INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THESE
FUNCTIONS. HE MUST ALSO ACQUAINT HIMSELF WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF THE
ORGANISATION HE SERVES AND ARRANGE HIS SERVICES TO MAKE A DEFINABLE
CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE ORGANISATIONAL OBJECTIVES. THE
OBJECTIVES OF THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS MUST BE USED AS PREMISES FOR
DETERMINING WHERE THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION FUNCTION SHOULD OPERATE AND HOW
ITS SERVICES SHOULD BE PRESENTED. THE INFORMATION SERVICE (WHICH CONSISTS OF 3
SECTIONS, A LIBRARY, TRANSLATION BUREAU AND INFORMATION DISSEMINATION) OF THE
SOUTH AFRICAN IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION (ISCOR) IS USED AS A
WORKING EXAMPLE. THE USE OF MBO BY ISC OR IS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED AND THE

MARKET ECONOMY CRITERIA CANNOT BE APPLIED TO THEM. THE PROVISION OF
INFORMATION AND LITERATURE MUST BE PLANNED RATIONALLY. MANY LIBRARIES HAVE HAD
TO ACCEPT CUTS IN THEIR BUDGETS ALTHOUGH THE PRICES OF BOOKS AND PERIODICALS

THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'FREE' PUBLIC LIBRARY.
     
FOR VARIOUS REASONS IT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR PUBLIC
LIBRARIES TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT FUNDS FROM THEIR AUTHORITIES, IN COMPETITION
WITH OTHER MORE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES ORIGINATED IN THE UK
DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY, THEIR MAIN FUNCTION BEING THE UPLIFTING
OF THE UNEDUCATED. TODAY PUBLIC LIBRARIES MAINLY CONCENTRATE ON THE SUPPLYING
OF LIGHT READING MATTER, ESPECIALLY NOVELS, OF WHICH THE MAJORITY ARE, FROM A
LITERARY POINT OF VIEW, OF A DUBIOUS NATURE. THE ARGUMENTS USED DURING THE
LAST CENTURY TO DEFEND THE PRINCIPLE OF FREE SERVICES ARE NO LONGER VALID
TODAY. THE FUNCTIONS OF THE MODERN PUBLIC LIBRARY ARE NEITHER FULLY PART OF
THE WORLD OF EDUCATION NOR THE WORLD OF RECREATION, WITH THE RESULT THAT ITS
IMAGE TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS OBSCURE. CONSIDERS THAT, ALTHOUGH CONTINUED
FINANCING OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES BY THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT IS
NECESSARY, NO VALID OBJECTION CAN BE FOUND TO CHARG E USERS FOR THOSE SERVICES
WHICH ARE NOT ESSENTIAL FOR THE AIMS WHICH THE PUBLIC LIBRARY PURSUES.

ACTIVITIES AND LEGISLATION LAYING DOWN MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES,
AS IN FINLAND, SHOULD BE ENACTED. AFTER THE BOOM IN THE 60S AND 70S, THE LOCAL
AUTHORITIES HAVE TO MAKE CUTS; AS THEY CANNOT REDUCE PREVIOUS CAPITAL
INVESTMENT THEY CUT CURRENT EXPENDITURE ON CULTURAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SCHOOLS
AND LIBRARIES, ALTHOUGH MONEY SEEMS ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR SPORT, BUREAUCRACY
AND DATA TECHNOLOGY. THE REAL POWER OF DECISION-MAKING LIES NOT WITH THE
CULTURAL, BUT WITH THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BUDGETING.

LIBRARIANSHIP, AS WELL AS THEIR PART IN LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS. WOMEN FIRST
BECAME ACCEPTED IN LIBRARIANSHIP WHEN THERE WERE INSUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF MEN
AVAILABLE. THE WOMEN, MOSTLY FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS, RUSHED INTO A PROFESSION
WHICH DID NOT DETRACT FROM SOCIAL PRESTIGE. STEREOTYPED IDEAS CONCERNING
FEMALE QUALITIES MADE THEIR ENTRANCE INTO THE PROFESSION EASIER' ACCURACY,
INDUSTRY, SELF-DENIAL AND SUBORDINATION ON THE ONE HAND; SOCIAL SENSITIVITY,
MOTHERLY FEELING AND INSIGHT INTO PEOPLE'S NATURE ON THE OTHER. THE GROWING
NUMBER OF WOMEN IN LIBRARIANSHIP MADE AN ORGAN FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF THEIR
INTERESTS DESIRABLE. THE 'VEREINIGUNG BIBLIOTEKARISCH ARBEITENDER FRAUEN',
FOUNDED IN 1907, MADE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE PAYMENT, INFORM INTERESTED PEOPLE
ABOUT THE PROFESSION AND ABOUT ED UCATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP, AND PROVIDED AN
EMPLOYMENT AGENCY. THE ASSOCIATION WAS DISSOLVED INTO THE 'REICHSVERBAND

THESE NEEDS IMMEDIATELY BY PROVIDING SELECTED DOCUMENTS IN RESPONSE TO PATIENT
CARE QUERIES, TO BUILD MULTIDISCIPLINARY DOCUMENT COLLECTIONS RELATING TO
SPECIFIC PATIENT CARE PROBLEMS, AND TO MAKE THESE AVAILABLE TO OTHER HOSPITALS
IN THE DISTRICT. THEY AIMED ALSO TO COMPILE VARIOUS PUBLICATIONS BASED ON THE

LIBRARIANS MORE SERVICE ORIENTATED, AND IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT RESEARCH TIME
FOR ACADEMICS WAS AT A PREMIUM. A METHODOLOGY WAS DEVISED AND 21 LECTURERS
FROM ACROSS THE ACADEMIC SPECTRUM SUBMITTED 27 PROFILES. REFERENCES WERE
SUPPLIED FROM JOURNALS AND MONOGRAPHS AND FROM ABSTRACTING TOOLS WHERE THE
LIBRARY HAD POOR LITERATURE COVERAGE. AT THE END OF THE 6 MONTHS, FEEDBACK
REVEALED THAT 93% OF THE REFERENCES ASSESSED (82%) WERE RELEVANT OR APPARENTLY
RELEVANT, SHOWING THAT BIBLIOGRAPHIC RATHER THAN TERMINOLOGICAL SKILLS WERE
THE SALIENT FACTOR. ACADEMIC RESPONSE WAS UNANIMOUSLY IN FAVOUR OF A
CONTINUATION OF THE SERVICE, WHILE A FEW RESPONDENTS WANTED MINOR
IMPROVEMENTS. THE SUBJECT LIBRARIANS FOUND THAT THE SERVICE INCREASED JOB
SATISFACTION AND ALLOWED THEM TO LOOK MORE CRITICALLY AT LIBRARY STOCK. IN
TERMS OF  TIME AND FINANCIAL COST THE SDI SERVICE WAS EASILY ABSORBED INTO THE
EXISTING WORK STRUCTURE OF THE LIBRARY. IT WAS FOUND TO BE PARTICULARLY
RELEVANT TO INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH, AND IT RELIED UPON A WELL-DEVELOPED

REFERENCE SERVICE, REFERENCE LIBRARIAN AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION.
     
REFERENCE SERVICE IS DEFINED AS A DIRECT INTERACTION BETWEEN THE USER AND THE
STAFF. REFERENCE LIBRARIANS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN COMMUNICATION OF INFORMATION.
THE MAJOR SOURCE OF INFORMATION IS THE ENORMOUS OUTPUT OF LITERATURE. THE
REFERENCE LIBRARIAN NEEDS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THESE SOURCES TO PROVIDE
THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT READER AT THE RIGHT TIME.

JOB MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION OF REFERENCE STAFF IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
ARGUES THAT DESPITE AUTOMATION, LIBRARY WORK WILL REMAIN LABOUR INTENSIVE; IT
IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL TO CONSIDER THE HUMAN ASPECT OF THE SITUATION,
PARTICULARLY IN REFERENCE WORK, WHERE IN GENERAL THE QUALITY IS LOW. TO
INVESTIGATE THE RELATION BETWEEN JOB MOTIVATION AND SATISFACTION, A SURVEY WAS
CARRIED OUT AMONG ONTARIO REFERENCE LIBRARY STAFF, USING TECHNIQUES OF
ANALYSIS AND MEASUREMENT ADAPTED FROM THE FIELD OF BUSINESS STUDIES. DETAILS
ARE GIVEN OF THE METHODOLOGY, QUESTIONNAIRE CONSTRUCTION, AND RATING

LITERARY MECCA IN JUNE ON PUSHKIN'S NAME-DAY. POEMS ARE READ AND SONGS
PERFORMED IN HIS HONOUR. LIBRARIANS SHOULD HELP READERS TO APPRECIATE
PUSHKIN'S POETRY. THE REGIONAL LIBRARY COULD COMPILE A WORK ON PUSHKIN BASED
ON THE MUSEUM'S VISITORS' BOOKS, DATING FROM 1899. READERS COULD BE ENCOURAGED
TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY DISCOVERED PUSHKIN. PUSHKIN LITERARY EVENINGS SHOULD
TREAT ONLY ONE OF HIS WORKS AND ADAPT TO THE AUDIENCE'S AGE GROUP. FOR THESE,
LIBRARIANS COULD STUDY VARIANTS OF HIS POEMS, THE SOCIAL LIFE AND POPULAR
CULTURE OF HIS TIME. THE PUSHKINOGORETS REGIONAL LIBRARY SHOULD BECOME A
REPOSITORY OF PUSHKIN AREA LEGENDS. THE MUSEUM STRIVES TO ENCOURAGE A LIVELY

POETRY, COFFEE AND CAKES: POETRY CAFE OSTERGARD.
     
DESCRIBES THE EFFORTS OF HALMSTAD PUBLIC LIBRARY TO PROMOTE POETRY. SWEDISH
PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACQUIRE VERY LITTLE POETRY, AND POETRY EVENINGS ARE AN
EXCEPTION. POETRY CAFE OSTERGARD BEGAN IN AUTUMN 80 WITH EVENING GATHERINGS
HELD IN HALMSTAD'S BRANCH LIBRARY IN OSTERGARD SCHOOL. THE AIM WAS NOT TO
REPLACE HALMSTAD CENTRAL LIBRARY'S AUTHOR EVENINGS, BUT TO COMPLEMENT THEM
WITH ACTIVITIES IN A BRANCH LIBRARY. NEW FORMS WERE SOUGHT WHICH INVOLVED THE
PARTICIPANTS IN ACTIVE LISTENING AND CONVERSATION. A CAFE ATMOSPHERE WITH
COFFEE AND CAKES WAS CREATED. MANY OF THE POETS LIVED LOCALLY. THE LIBRARY
PRINTS POSTERS AND ADVERTISES IN THE LOCAL PRESS AND RADIO PRIOR TO EACH
EVENING AND PREPARES FREE FOLDERS WITH POEMS AND INTRODUCTIONS TO THE POETS.
EMPHASISES THAT THERE MUST BE CONTINUITY THROUGH REGULAR ACTIVITIES AND THAT
MORE PERSONAL CONTACT TO PROMOTE THE EVENINGS AND MORE PARTICIPATION BY
AMATEUR POETS ARE NEEDED IF THE CAFE IS TO CONT INUE.

THE LITERATURE SEARCH THAT WENT UP IN SMOKE.
     
SINCE 1977, THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS STRESSED THAT AUTOMATION IN LIBRARIES
SHOULD BEGIN WITH BIBLIOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS. BIBLIOTEKSDATA HAS REPLIED THAT THEIR
DEVELOPMENT PLANS AGREE WITH THIS PRIORITY, BUT ADDS THAT LOCAL LIBRARIES MUST
BE FREE TO DECIDE WHICH AUTOMATION SYSTEM TO USE. FEARS THAT BIBLIOTEKSDATA,
IN EFFECT, IS GIVING PRIORITY TO AUTOMATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS, SUCH AS
ISSUES AND ACQUISITIONS, ALTHOUGH THE UNION HAS ARGUED THE NEED FOR TERMINAL
ACCESS FOR LIBRARIES TO THE BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATA BASE. PROVISION OF SUCH ACCESS
HAS BEEN HELD UP BY THE FACT THAT THE QUESTION OF THE BEST SUBJECT SEARCH
SYSTEM HAS NOT YET BEEN SOLVED. MEANTIME, HOWEVER, ATTEMPTS SHOULD BE MADE TO
PROVIDE TERMINAL ACCESS WITH FREE TEXT SEARCHING, SIMILAR SEARCHING ON
MICROFORM, AND EXPANSION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES WITH SUBJECT WORDS. ARGUES
THAT THE LIMITED RESOURCES SHOULD BE CONCENTRATED ON THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA'
SERVICES.

UNIMARC.
     
SEVERAL AGENCIES THAT WERE FORMERLY SATISFIED BY SINGLE CONVERSIONS FROM
ANOTHER FORMAT ARE BEGINNING TO REQUIRE DATA FROM MULTIPLE AGENCIES. EITHER
MULTIPLE CONVERSIONS MUST BE WRITTEN OR A SWITCH TO UNIMARC COULD TAKE PLACE.
THE COST SAVINGS WITH UNIMARC ARE OBVIOUS. MULTIPLE CONVERSIONS PROGRAMMES
REPRESENT A HIGH INITIAL INVESTMENT AND A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM IN KEEPING UP
WITH ALL OF THE CHANGES TO NECESSARILY DYNAMIC NATIONAL FORMATS. THE
INTRODUCTION OF AACR2 AND RESULTANT NATIONAL FORMAT CHANGES ARE AT THIS TIME
CAUSING SEVERAL AGENCIES TO REWRITE CONVERSION PROGRAMMES. A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO
A TRULY INTERNATIONAL UNIMARC EXCHANGE IS THAT THE CHANGE TAKES A JOINT

THE GUIDELINE ON STOCK EXPANSION IN GENERAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES.
     
IN THE 1976-80 GUIDELINES ON LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY, LONG-TERM STOCK
PLANNING WAS ADVOCATED ON A BASIS OF DIFFERENTIAL VALUES FOR STOCK ITEMS PER
INHABITANT, SO THAT STOCKS CAN BE ACQUIRED WHICH ALLOW FOR SOCIAL DEMANDS.
FUNCTIONAL EQUIPPING OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF LIBRARY IS NECESSARY TO FACILITATE
REGIONAL PURCHASING SCHEME DEVELOPMENT. THE STOCK GUIDELINE FOR 1981-85
EMPHASISES STOCK EXPANSION AND THE PURCHASE OF REPLACEMENT COPIES; OTHER
GUIDELINES COVER THE EXPANSION OF AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA SERVICES, NEW RULES ON
THE PURCHASE OF PERIODICALS AND NEWSPAPERS AND EXTRA PROVISION OF BOOKS IN
HOLIDAY RESORTS. THE LATEST GUIDELINES SHOULD REMOVE UNJUSTIFIABLE DIFFERENCES
IN STOCK STANDARDS.

SELECTED ASPECTS FROM THE CHANGE OF GUIDELINES ON STOCK EXPANSION IN LIBRARIES
IN THE LEIPZIG AREA.
     
IN 1975 THE NUMBER OF STOCK ITEMS PER INHABITANT IN LEIPZIG LIBRARIES WAS
SLIGHTLY BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, SO PLANS FOR 1976-80 EMPHASISED STOCK
EXPANSION. VARIABLE PROVISION STANDARDS WERE CALCULATED FOR CENTRAL AND BRANCH
LIBRARIES. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF RESULTS FOR THIS PERIOD SHOWS A LARGE STOCK
BUDGET, SO THAT IN SEVERAL AREAS THE REQUIRED LEVELS OF STOCK PROVISION WERE
REACHED OR EVEN EXCEEDED. ONLY SOME OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED AREAS FELL
BELOW THE REQUISITE STANDARDS. OTHER AIMS FOR 1976-80 WERE THE EXPANSION AND
QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF STOCKS IN THE CENTRAL LIBRARY AND THE RAISING OF
PERIODICAL SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES. PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY WAS EXPERIENCED WITH
STOCKS FOR RURAL LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY FOR PART-TIME BRANCH LIBRARIES;
GUIDELINES FOR 1981-85 AIM TO IMPROVE THIS ASPECT OF THE SERVICE.

INSTITUTIONS WITHIN THE REGION, OR COPIES FOR USE WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY; A
POLICY OF WITHDRAWAL WAS DEVELOPED, AS NO ARCHIVAL DUTY EXISTS. PROBLEMS WERE
CAUSED BY THE NUMBER AND LATE DELIVERY OF PERIODICALS. HANDLING OF LEAFLETS

THE GROWTH OF THE HUNGARIAN INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S OBJECTIVES AND
RESEARCH TEAM, THE LACK OF SPACE AND THE RISE IN JOURNAL PRICES INDUCED THE
LIBRARIANS TO EXAMINE THE USAGE OF JOURNALS. THEY WISHED TO ESTABLISH JOURNALS
WHICH NEED NOT BE SUBSCRIBED TO ANY LONGER; JOURNALS WHICH COULD BE PLACED IN
REMOTE STORAGE; AND JOURNALS WHICH READERS REGULARLY REQUIRE BUT WHICH ARE NOT
AVAILABLE IN THE LIBRARY. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 1 NOV 77 -30 APR 78. AS A
RESULT OF THE INVESTIGATION IT CAN BE LAID DOWN THAT THE LIBRARY CAN COMPLY,
FROM ITS OWN STOCK, WITH A LARGE PART OF READERS' DEMANDS FOR JOURNALS. THE
SMALLER PART (29%) OF THE STOCK FULFILS 77% OF DEMANDS, THE LARGER PROPORTION
IS LITTLE USED. THE NUMBER OF JOURNALS NOT USED AT ALL IS SMALL. JOURNALS USED
LESS WILL BE PUT IN DISTANT STACKS; CURRENT JOURNALS AND OFTEN USED VOLUMES

SEMANTIC CATALOGUES EXIST IN A LOGICAL STATE OF PROBABILITY NOT ONLY BECAUSE
OF THE TEMPORAL DISTANCE BETWEEN THEIR PREPARATION AND CONSULTATION, BUT
BECAUSE THEY CAN NEVER BE VERIFIED, EXCEPT AFTER A GREAT TIME LAG. THE PROBLEM
IS ALWAYS THE SEARCH FOR FORMULAE FOR REFERENCES PROVIDING THE GREATEST

SCHEME IN THE WESTERN WORLD FOR CONVERTING CYRILLIC CHARACTERS INTO ROMAN
SCRIPT. TRANSCRIPTION, BY WHICH CYRILLIC CHARACTERS ARE ROMANIZED INTO
PHONEMES, GIVES GOOD RESULTS FOR PRONUNCIATION BUT LEADS TO A NUMBER OF
ALTERNATIVE SPELLINGS, WHILST TRANSLITERATION, BY WHICH A SINGLE ROMAN
CHARACTER IS SUBSTITUTED FOR EACH CYRILLIC CHARACTER LEADS TO PRONUNCIATION
DIFFICULTIES. WITH THE GROWTH IN SCHEMES FOR CATALOGUE AUTOMATION IT IS
ESSENTIAL THAT A SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THIS PROBLEM. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT
THE ISO STANDARD OFFERS THE BEST SOLUTION ALTHOUGH THIS HAS UNFORTUNATELY
FOUND LITTLE FAVOUR IN THE USA AND UK.

COMPUTERISATION OF THE CURRENT NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.
     
A SCHEME FOR THE COMPUTERISATION OF THE CURRENT NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IN
BULGARIA HAS BEEN IN PROGRESS SINCE 1978 AND ALL MAJOR SCIENTIFIC AND CENTRAL
REGIONAL LIBRARIES ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEME. 8
SERIES ARE PLANNED, INCLUDING A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF CONTEMPORARY BULGARIAN
LITERATURE, AND BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF PUBLICATIONS ISSUED BY VARIOUS GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES, DISSERTATIONS, GRAMOPHONE RECORDS, AND BULGARIAN PERIODICALS AND
ARTICLES IN DAILY PAPERS. THERE WILL ALSO BE A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF FOREIGN
LITERATURE ON BULGARIA, TOGETHER WITH 1 OF BULGARIAN BIBLIOGRAPHIES. THE
FREQUENCY OF PUBLICATION WILL RANGE FROM 1 WEEK, AS IN THE CASE OF CATALOGUE
CARDS, THROUGH BI-WEEKLY, MONTHLY AND QUARTERLY BULLETINS TO ANNUAL INDEXES OR
EVEN CUMULATIVE INDEXES PUBLISHED ONCE EVERY FEW YEARS. THE INTRODUCTION OF AN
APPROPRIATE SYSTEM, INCLUDING MINICOMPUTERS AND VIDEOTERMINI, MUST BE

CORRECT CULTURAL AND OTHER POLICIES. THUS DEPARTMENTS OF LOCAL HISTORY IN
LIBRARIES, AND THOSE IN THE CENTRAL DISTRICT LIBRARIES IN PARTICULAR, HAVE THE
DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO BUILD UP APPROPRIATE BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESOURCES. IN
ADDITION TO BOOKS, DAILY PAPERS AND PERIODICALS, NON-BOOK MATERIALS SUCH AS
RECORDS, TAPES, DOCUMENTARY FILMS, SLIDES, PHOTOS AND PICTURE POSTCARDS HAVE
BECOME RATHER SIGNIFICANT. AS TO CONTENTS, MATERIALS HAVE TO BE SIFTED VERY

THE CRISIS OF DANISH SPECIALISED BIBLIOGRAPHIES.
     
ARGUES THAT, WHEREAS THE DANISH NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY IS IN NO DANGER AS IT IS
SUBSIDISED THROUGH THE LIBRARY CENTRE AND ACQUIRED WIDELY BY ALL TYPES OF

IDEOLOGICAL BIAS AND BOOKS FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS IN BRAZIL.
     
PRESENTS THE CONCLUSIONS OF A PAPER GIVEN AT A BRAZILIAN SEMINAR ON LITERATURE
FOR CHILDREN IN 1978. 21 CHILDREN'S BOOKS BY BRAZILIAN AUTHORS WERE EXAMINED,
AND FOUND TO BE COMPOSED ACCORDING TO A RIGID PREDETERMINED STRUCTURE BASED ON
A CLEAR AND ABSOLUTE DEMARCATION OF GOOD AND EVIL, BACKED BY AN IDEOLOGY
LEGITIMISING THE POWER OF ADULTS OVER CHILDREN. DRAWS A PARALLEL WITH THE
SUBLITERATURE OF 19TH CENTURY FRANCE, AND POSTULATES THAT BRAZILIAN CHILDREN'S
LITERATURE IS FUNDAMENTALLY A PRODUCT OF THE PREVAILING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC
ORDER, REFLECTING IN THE DEPICTION OF THE PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP THE
PRODUCER-CONSUMER RELATIONSHIP OF INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY. THE INTRODUCTION OF
SUPERFICIALLY CONTEMPORARY MATERIAL IN LANGUAGE AND PHYSICAL DETAIL DOES NOT
AFFECT THE ESSENTIALLY REACTIONARY CHARACTER OF SUCH WORKS, AND THIS
IDEOLOGICAL RIGIDITY EXPLAINS THEIR LOW LITERARY QUALITY.

LIBRARIANS MUST BE ALERT TO THE POWER OF EVIL, BUT TO CONCEAL IT IS NOT TO

OF REAL LIFE AS THEY ARE REFLECTED BROADLY IN THE PUBLISHING WORLD; AND
FINALLY, LIBRARIANS SHOULD BEA LIFE-ENHANCING AND A LIFE-AFFIRMING INFLUENCE

ACTIVITY. MODERN KIBBUTZ SOCIETY AND ORGANISATION HAVE CHANGED, BUT MANY SMALL
LIBRARIES HAVE REMAINED IN EXISTENCE. DECENTRALISATION HAS MANY DRAWBACKS'
INEFFICIENCY, AREAS OF INTEREST NOT COVERED BY ANY LIBRARY, INCONVENIENCE OF

SHOULD HOPE BE ABANDONED BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS?.

THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE WORD 'PUBLIC' MUST BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY IN
CONNECTION WITH LIBRARIES. PARTICULAR PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED IN SELECTING FICTION
AND LEISURE MATERIAL. READERS DISLIKE EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF TRIVIAL MATERIAL AS
MUCH AS THE ELITIST APPROACH BUT THE ILLITERACY OF SOME SECTIONS OF THE PUBLIC
IS PREFERABLE TO THE TOTAL ABSTINENCE OF THE NON-READER. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY
MUST BRING A NEW QUALITY TO ITS PUBLIC SERVICE, EXERCISING A CORRECTIVE
FUNCTION IN RESPECT OF BOOK MARKET TRENDS. LIBRARIANS MUST MOUNT AN OFFENSIVE
ACTION IN PURSUIT OF THE SENSIBLE, SOCIAL AND HUMANE ASPECTS OF THEIR SERVICE.
IT IS DANGEROUS TO ATTACH TOO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO STATISTICS. LITERATURE SHOULD
BE PROVIDED THAT CROSSES ALL ARBITRARY BORDERS AND STIMULATES THE MIND.

SINCE WORLD WAR II THERE HAS BEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH IN THE NETHERLANDS
IN THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC SERVICES, INCLUDING MEDICAL CARE, SOCIAL WELFARE

COME ABOUT BY THE SUDDEN EXPANSION OF SEPARATE SECTORS. IN THE LAST 10 YEARS
CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC SERVICES HAS BECOME A SUBJECT FOR MUCH DISCUSSION IN THE
DUTCH PARLIAMENT WITH THE RESULT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE PROVISION FOR
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO HAVE A GREATER SAY IN THE RUNNING OF THESE SERVICES.
IN FUTURE FACTORS WHICH WILL SERIOUSLY AFFECT PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES INCLUDE
THE SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE REDUCED
BIRTH-RATE. TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES A REFORM OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES IS
NECESSARY.

FRAMEWORK LAW. EACH STATE HAS A CENTRAL LIBRARY AND THERE ARE ALSO CENTRAL
REGIONAL LIBRARIES IN MADRAS, BOMBAY AND DELHI. BELOW THESE ARE THE DISTRICT
LIBRARIES, EACH RESPONSIBLE FOR BETWEEN 40 AND 80 BRANCH LIBRARIES. MOBILE
LIBRARIES SERVE AREAS WHERE POPULATION IS PARTICULARLY SCATTERED. THERE ARE
ALSO UNIVERSITY AND TECHNICAL COLLEGE LIBRARIES AND SOME PRIVATE LENDING
LIBRARIES. CURRENT PROBLEMS INCLUDE A LARGE POPULATION, A WIDE RANGE OF ETHNIC
GROUPS, RELIGIONS AND LANGUAGES, ILLITERACY, INADEQUATE SCHOOLING AND A
SHORTAGE OF MONEY.

THE CAMPAIGN FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN NEW SOUTH WALES, 1929-1950.

THE PERIOD 1890-1930 WITNESSED A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN
NEW SOUTH WALES BUT BY 1930 SEVERAL PROMINENT CITIZENS BEGAN TO SEE THEM AS
USEFUL ADJUNCTS TO THE CAMPAIGN TO IMPROVE AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION. THE CARNEGIE
CORPORATION OF NEW YORK PROVIDED FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND THE FREE LIBRARY
MOVEMENT WAS SET UP IN SYDNEY. MASS DEMAND FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS NOT REALLY
A MOTIVE FORCE IN THE REVIVAL. WORLD WAR 2 EMPHASISED THE NEED TO PRESERVE
DEMOCRACY THROUGH EDUCATION AND ALSO ESTABLISHED THE IDEA THAT CULTURE WAS NOT
THE PRESERVE OF THE INTELLECTUAL ELITE ALONE. POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION BROUGHT
WITH IT A TIDE OF LARGELY BRITISH IMMIGRANTS WHO HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS OF
PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES. THE IMPETUS PROVIDED BY THE WAR WAS SHORT LIVED,
HOWEVER, AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES WERE FORCED TO STAND ALONE. THIS TIME THEY WERE
ABLE TO SURVIVE THROUGH THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE LIBRARIANS.

N.K. KRUPSKAYA AND CURRENT PROBLEMS IN THE ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY SERVICES TO
RURAL POPULATIONS.

RAISING THE CULTURAL LEVEL OF LIFE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE IS STILL A MAJOR TASK OF
SOVIET LIBRARIANSHIP IN THE 1980S. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAVE PRODUCED GREAT
QUANTITATIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN RURAL LIBRARY SERVICES, BUT QUALITATIVELY MUCH
STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE. N.K. KRUPSKAYA WAS CLOSELY INVOLVED WITH THIS VERY
PROBLEM IN THE 1930S AND HER RECOMMENDATIONS ARE STILL VALID TODAY. IF WHAT
SHE WROTE THEN CAN BE PUT INTO PRACTICE NOW, THE GAP BETWEEN THE LEVELS OF
SERVICE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY CAN BE RAPIDLY NARROWED.

LIBRARIES, RADIO AND TELEVISION IN WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE.

THERE ARE 3 MAIN WAYS IN WHICH LIBRARIES AND THE MEDIA CAN COOPERATE. RADIO
AND TELEVISION CAN BROADCAST RELEVANT PROGRAMMES SUCH AS DISCUSSIONS,
INTERVIEWS WITH AUTHORS AND STORY READINGS. LIBRARIANS CAN USE TELEVISION AND
RADIO TO FOCUS THE ATTENTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE ON PARTICULAR ISSUES,
RECOMMENDING PROGRAMMES AND LINKING BOOK DISPLAYS TO THEM. ALTERNATIVELY,
LIBRARIANS CAN BE ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION OF PROGRAMMES AND CAN
USE THEM TO PUBLICISE POPULAR LITERATURE AND AUTHORS. A SURVEY, UNDERTAKEN IN

NEEDS WAS BROKEN DRAMATICALLY IN 1949 BY THE CONSTRUCTION OF LAMONT LIBRARY,
THE HARVARD UNDERGRADUATE FACILITY. ALTHOUGH DESIGNED TO SOLVE PROBLEMS UNIQUE
TO HARVARD, LAMONT WAS AN EXEMPLARY CONSTRUCTION THAT SOON CAPTURED THE

'DIFFERENT', AS WELL AS THE ADVISABI LITY OF FACILITIES EFFECTIVELY
SEGREGATING THEM FROM THE REST OF THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY, CAME UNDER ATTACK IN

AN ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DENSITY-OF-USE RANKING AND RAW USE
RANKING OF LIBRARY JOURNAL USE.

REPORTS OF JOURNAL TITLES RANKED BY USE WITH SPACE AND COST INFORMATION
INCLUDED FOR EACH TITLE CAN PROVIDE A MEANS FOR MAKING CERTAIN OBJECTIVE
JOURNAL COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS. EACH TITLE CAN BE ASSESSED IN
RELATION TO THE OTHERS AND THE DATA FOR ALL TITLES CAN BE CUMULATED SO THAT
DECISIONS CAN BE MADE AT VARIOUS CUTOFF POINTS. SIMPLE RANKING OF TITLES BY
RAW USE (RUR) MAY BE INADEQUATE AND SHOULD BE ADJUSTED BY SOME MEASURE TO
ALLOW FOR HOW MUCH OF THE TITLE IS AVAILABLE TO THE USER AT THE TIME OF THE
COLLECTION OF THE USE DATA. IF THE RAW-USE FREQUENCY OF A TITLE IS DIVIDED BY
THE ACTUAL LINEAR SHELF SPACE OF THE TITLE'S FILE, A 'DENSITY-OF-USE'
FREQUENCY IS OBTAINED. IF THESE FREQUENCIES ARE THEN RANKED, A 'DENSITY-OF-USE

BUDGETS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT EMPHEMERAL LITERATURE HAS A RELAXING
EFFECT ON MANY PEOPLE, IN CONTRAST TO THE STIMULATING EFFECT CAUSED BY MORE
DEMANDING WORKS. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO EXCLUDE LESS VALUABLE
MATERIAL, SUCH AS WORKS INVOLVING PORNOGRAPHY AND VIOLENCE AND THEN TO INCLUDE
SOME TRIVIA IF CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF READER STRUCTURE DEMANDS IT.

HOW CAN YOUR SON BECOME A READER?.

THE MOSCOW AND TUL'SK PAEDAGOGIC INSTITUTES RECENTLY INVESTIGATED
SCHOOLCHILDREN'S WANING INTEREST IN FICTION AND FOUND ELEMENTARY
SCHOOLCHILDREN READ LITTLE AND WERE INDIFFERENT TO FICTION. THE
EXTRA-CURRICULAR READING PROJECT FOR 1ST TO 3RD FORMS EVOLVED. HERE CHILDREN
LEARN TO EXAMINE BOOKS CAREFULLY BEFORE DECIDING ON SELECTION. AFTER 6 MONTHS
OF THIS INSTRUCTION, 65% OF 1ST-FORMERS WERE QUICKLY ABLE TO FIND THE BOOKS
REQUIRED. THE METHOD IS SUPPLEMENTED BY READING ALOUD STORIES ABOUT THE TEXT,
LITERARY GAMES, COMPETITIONS, ETC. THE AIM IS TO FAMILIARISE 1ST TO
3RD-FORMERS WITH SOME OF THE BEST RUSSIAN, SOVIET AND FOREIGN LITERATURE.
LIBRARIANS SHOULD CONSOLIDATE ON THESE EARLIEST SCHOOL READING HABITS. SCHOOL

THE PLANNABLE AND UNPLANNABLE (1)' LIBRARIES AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF
PRESERVATION AND CHANGE.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND
THE ASSOCIATION OF LIBRARIANS IN NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA, OCT 80. LIBRARY
SERVICES MUST REACT AND DEVELOP IN RELATION TO SOCIAL CHANGE. THEY MUST CATER
FOR THE NEEDS OF BOTH URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES, WHERE TOWN AND COUNTRY
PLANNING HAS SO OFTEN FAILED. WORKING HOURS ARE SHORTER NOW THAN IN THE PAST,
SO LIBRARIES MUST DEVELOP FACILITIES FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RECREATIONAL READING
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MASS MEDIA. CHILDREN USE LIBRARIES MORE THAN ADULTS
BUT THE BIRTH RATE HAS FALLEN AND THERE ARE MORE ELDERLY PEOPLE IN THE
COMMUNITY TODAY THAN BEFORE; THIS, HOWEVER, IS NO EXCUSE FOR A DECLINE IN
LIBRARY STANDARDS. LIBRARIES MUST BECOME COMMUNICATION CENTRES, IN PARTICULAR

PRESERVATION AND CHANGE.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION AND

(FOR PART 1, 2SEE1 PREVIOUS ABSTRACT). LIBRARIES EXIST TO FULFIL HUMAN NEEDS
FOR EDUCATION, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION AND GENERAL SELF-DEVELOPMENT. FUTURE
LIBRARY PLANNING MUST PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BALANCE OF STATIONARY AND
MOBILE ELEMENTS IN A SYSTEM, TO LOCAL NEEDS AND TO ADULT EDUCATION. BOTH
QUALIFIED LIBRARIANS AND VOLUNTARY HELPERS CAN MAKE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO
LIBRARY SERVICES; STAFF OF HIGH CALIBRE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE MEDIA
THEMSELVES OR ADVANCED TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT. TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY IN A LIBRARY
CAN ALIENATE THE READERS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO GENERALISE ABOUT MINIMUM
STANDARDS; EACH LIBRARY NEEDS ITS OWN IDENTITY.

A GLOOMY OUTLOOK FOR LIBRARIES?.

PUBLIC LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT HAS HALTED AT A POINT WHEN, BECAUSE OF THE
RECESSION, LIBRARY SERVICES ARE PARTICULARLY NECESSARY. CURRENT ECONOMIC
MEASURES HAVE HIT LIBRARIES HARD. SOME PEOPLE NOW REGARD INFORMATION AS
MERCHANDISE FOR WHICH A SUITABLE MARKET PRICE MUST BE OBTAINED; THIS INCREASES
THE RISK OF INFORMATION SERVICES BEING TAKEN OVER BY PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH
COULD LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN STATE BUDGETS. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY THREATENS TO BYPASS THE LIBRARY SERVICE AND BECAUSE OF
THE COMPETITIVE SITUATION ON THE INFORMATION MARKET LIBRARIES ARE BEING ASKED
TO RESTRICT THEMSELVES TO THEIR TRADITIONAL TASKS. LIBRARIES MUST MOBILISE
RESERVES HITHERTO UNUSED; REFUSING TO IMPLEMENT NEW METHODS OF LITERATURE
PROVISION COULD HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES. INITIAL ORGANISATIONAL PROBLEMS
CAN BE OVERCOME THROUGH RATIONALISATION, CENTRALISATION AND WIDER USE OF

IN THE 1950S SOME INTERIOR STRUCTURAL ALTERATIONS WERE MADE TO IMPROVE THE
GENERAL EFFICIENCY OF THE LIBRARY. FROM 1959 TO 1978 VARIOUS PLANS WERE MADE
FOR NEW UNIVERSITY LIBRARY BUILDINGS. THESE INCLUDED AN EXTENSION TO THE
LIBRARY IN PART OF THE OLD TOWN OF HEIDELBERG, A NEW BUILDING ON A NEW SITE TO
SERVE THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC FACULTIES AND SMALL EXTENSIONS FOR EXTRA

EXPERIENCES AT THE CONTROL CENTRE OF THE INFORMATION SYSTEM ON AGRICULTURE AND
FOOD IN THE GERMAN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.

2 TYPES OF STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION AND THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES INVOLVED IN
INFORMATION WORK ARE DESCRIBED WHICH HAVE PROVED THEMSELVES HELPFUL IN THE
CREATION OF AN EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SERVICE FOR THE SUBJECT AREAS OF
AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FOOD ECONOMICS AND THEIR USE IS ILLUSTRATED WITH
REFERENCE TO INFORMATION ON MILK MARKETING AND GENERAL COOPERATION WITHIN THE

DEMONSTRATES HOW RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES CAN
BE USED IN ADMINISTRATION. THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION IN DECISION MAKING IS
DISCUSSED WITH REFERENCE TO THE MANAGER'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR COORDINATING
ACCESS TO INFORMATION RESOURCES AND ENSURING THAT EXPLOITATION IS COST
EFFECTIVE. PROPOSES A PRACTICAL MODEL FOR ORGANISING AN INTEGRATED INFORMATION
SERVICE, SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE TO DRAW ON ALL AVAILABLE EXISTING INFORMATION
NETWORKS IN AN ORGANISATION, THROUGH A COMMON CODIFICATION. THEN DISCUSSES
CODIFICATION OPERATIONS, EMPHASISING THE IMPORTANCE OF STANDARDISATION HERE IF
THE INFORMATION SYSTEM IS TO FUNCTION SUCCESSFULLY.

LIBRARIANS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES.

DISCUSSES HOW THE LIBRARIAN CAN SERVE THE INFORMATION NEEDS OF A SPECIALISED
TYPE OF ORGANISATION AND CONSIDERS HOW INFORMATION IS USED IN GOVERNMENT AND
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE, ITS IMPORTANCE AS A RESOURCE, AND WHAT INFORMATION
MANAGEMENT INVOLVES. THE LIBRARIAN ACCORDINGLY MUST ADAPT HIS SKILLS TO THE
DEMANDS OF THE PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT, WHERE INVOLVEMENT IN INFORMATION
MANAGEMENT AND THE ORGANISATION'S OPERATIONS REQUIRES ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN
PLANNING ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONS SUPPORT. SUGGESTS HOW SIMILAR ORGANISATIONS
COULD SHARE INFORMATION RESOURCES THROUGH NETWORK COOPERATION, AND ILLUSTRATES
THE LIBRARIAN'S ROLE IN SUPPORTING ORGANISATION OPERATIONS. FINALLY EMPHASISES
THE IMPORTANCE OF ADAPTING TRAINING PROGRAMMES TO RECOGNISE THE KIND OF
DEMANDS THE LIBRARIAN WILL MEET IN THIS CONTEXT.

THE INCORPORATION OF PATENT INFORMATION IN THE INFORMATION SYSTEM ON CIVIL
ENGINEERING.

IF MORE INFORMATION ON PATENTS IS INCLUDED IN THE CIVIL ENGINEERING
INFORMATION SYSTEM, WIDER AND MORE RATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS WILL RESULT AND MORE
HELP CAN BE GIVEN TO OTHER NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS.
PATENT INFORMATION SERVICES SHOULD PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION OF LITERATURE,
SEARCHING, SELECTIVE INFORMATION DISSEMINATION, MAINTENANCE OF A MINIMAL STOCK
OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MATERIAL ON PATENTS, AN EXPRESS COPYING SERVICE,
PRODUCTION OF BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND COOPERATION WITH THE OTHER INFORMATION
SERVICES. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS SHOULD SHOW IMPROVED COOPERATION WITH OTHER
PATENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND WITH SERVICE USERS AND MORE RESEARCH INTO
TERMINOLOGY AND STAFF TRAINING METHODS. THE SYSTEM SHOULD RELEASE SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH WORKERS FROM MUCH ROUTINE WORK.

CREATIVE ACTIVITIES ARE CURRENTLY FASHIONABLE; IN INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION THEY HAVE PRODUCED A VAST QUANTITY OF LITERATURE, MOST OF WHICH
MUST ULTIMATELY BE DISCARDED FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. NEVERTHELESS THESE
ACTIVITIES ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE EACH STUDENT AND RESEARCHER SHOULD OFFER HIS

PRESENTING IT TO THE USER IN A PRACTICAL FORM. AT PRESENT THIS TYPE OF
MATERIAL (BIBLIOGRAPHICAL MATERIAL, INCLUDING LIBRARY CATALOGUES) IS NOT
COLLECTED BY LIBRARIES IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES AS IT IS OFTEN NOT AVAILABLE
THROUGH NORMAL MARKET SOURCES VIA PUBLISHERS. AS INFORMATION MATERIAL IS
GENERALLY IN A PROCESSED FORM, LIBRARIES DO NOT ALWAYS CLASSIFY THE CONTENTS
FURTHER. HOWEVER, THE FORM IN WHICH THE MATERIAL IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE USER
IS VERY IMPORTANT AS IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE INDEPENDENT USE OF THE
INFORMATION. OFTEN THE MATERIAL IS CLASSIFIED TO BE USED BY PARTICULAR USER
GROUPS, FIRMS, LIBRARY COLLECTIVES OR SECTORS OF THE INFORMATION AND
DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM. LIBRARIES MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHICH USER GROUPS
NEED WHICH INFORMATION MATERIAL IN THEIR AREA AND ALSO WORK WITH OTHER
LIBRARIES TO PROVIDE A LARGER SELECTION OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

THEFT AND DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS' THE LEGAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR
DEALING WITH THEFT FROM THE COLLECTIONS AND DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS.

EACH YEAR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL IS WRITTEN OFF BY PUBLIC LIBRARIES
AS A RESULT OF THEFT OR DAMAGE BY LIBRARY USERS. IN THE MAASTRICHT PUBLIC
LIBRARY IN THE NETHERLANDS A STUDY OF THE PROBLEM MADE FROM JAN-JUNE 81 SHOWED
THAT SOME MATERIAL WAS REMOVED FROM THE LIBRARY WITHOUT REGISTERING THE
TRANSACTION, SOME WAS BORROWED ON TICKETS CONTAINING FALSE OR INCORRECT
INFORMATION, WHILE OTHERS WERE BORROWED AND NOT RETURNED, OR RETURNED IN A
DAMAGED CONDITION. WHERE PROOF OF THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OF LIBRARY PROPERTY
EXISTS THE DUTCH CIVIL CODE ALLOWS LIBRARY AUTHORITIES TO INSTRUCT THE LOCAL
CHIEF INSPECTOR OF JUSTICE TO TAKE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE GUILTY PARTY.
WHERE THE DEFENDANT IS FOUND GUILTY THE JUDGE MAY ORDER COMPENSATION TO BE
MADE TO THE LIBRARY CONCERNED.

BEING PREVENTED AND CHARGES BEING BROUGHT FOR THEFT. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF
THESE CHARGES HAVE HAD TO BE DROPPED OWING TO LOOPHOLES IN LAWS APPLICABLE TO
BOOK THEFTS. GERMAN CRIMINAL LAW STIPULATES THAT THE INTENTION OF KEEPING AN
OBJECT MUST BE PRESENT TO CONSTITUTE A THEFT; THIS IS USUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO
PROVE IN THE CASE OF BOOK THEFTS. UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW ALSO FAILS TO

AN ON-LINE REGIONAL UNION CATALOG OF MONOGRAPHS AND AUDIOVISUALS' A
DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.

THE PROJECT'S OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE AN ON-LINE REGIONAL UNION CATALOGUE OF
MONOGRAPHS AND AUDIOVISUAL MATERIALS USING EXISTING MACHINE READABLE RECORDS
OF PARTICIPATING LIBRARIES CREATED IN A VARIETY OF SYSTEMS. THE RESULTANT FILE
WILL BE SEARCHABLE BY AUTHOR, TITLE, SUBJECT AND KEYWORD, AND WILL FACILITATE
RESOURCE-SHARING BY EXPEDITING THE PROVISION OF MONOGRAPHS AND AUDIOVISUAL
MATERIALS WITHIN A 6-STATE REGION OF THE USA; IT WILL FURTHER PROVIDE VALUABLE
STATISTICAL INFORMATION FOR COORDINATING COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT. 1 IMPORTANT
ASPECT IS THE EXPEDITING OF INTERLIBRARY LOAN REQUESTS, BY AUTOMATIC
GENERATION AND THE STORAGE IN MASSAGE FILES FOR THE HOLDING LIBRARY, WITHOUT
THE REKEYBOARDING OF DATA.

A WONDERFUL TOY.

THE DANISH TECHNICAL LIBRARY AT THE DANISH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY SET UP A DATA
BASE IN 1968 CONTAINING LOCATIONS OF THE LIBRARY'S OWN HOLDINGS. AT THE END OF
THE 70S THIS FACILITY WAS EXPANDED TO AN ON-LINE SYSTEM OF LOCATING ALSO OTHER
LIBRARIES' ACQUISITIONS AND CONNECTED TO SCANNET AND EURONET. DESCRIBES A NEW
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM, CALLED ALIS (AUTOMATED LIBRARY INFORMATION SYSTEM),
INITIATED IN NOV 81. IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO REQUISITION TITLES THROUGH THE ALIS
CATALOGUES. THESE TITLES WILL BE THOSE READILY AVAILABLE, AS THE LIBRARY'S
LOANS WILL BE REGISTERED IN THE TERMINAL FROM 1982. USE OF ALIS IS FREE. THE
SYSTEM, DESCRIBED DIAGRAMMATICALLY, CONSISTS OF A LOCAL SYSTEM FOR
ADMINISTRATION OF LOANS, AND THE I/S DATACENTRALEN'S FREE TEXT STANDARD SEARCH
SYSTEM.

SOME CURRENT ISSUES IN PLANNING FOR LIBRARY AUTOMATION AT THE STATE LEVEL.

THE CONNECTICUT AUTOMATION COORDINATING COMMITTEE (CACC) WAS FORMED IN 1980 TO
PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL GROUPS, LIBRARIES AND ORGANISATIONS ENGAGED IN
OR INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING AUTOMATED SYSTEMS TO MEET REGULARLY TO SHARE
INFORMATION AND TO BEGIN AN INFORMAL PLANNING EFFORT. DISCUSSES MAJOR ISSUES
THAT THE CACC HAS FACED WHICH HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER STATES. A STATEWIDE
ON-LINE UNION CATALOGUE IS LIKELY TO CONSIST OF COMPONENTS DEVELOPED
INDEPENDENTLY BY INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES OR GROUPS OF LIBRARIES WHICH HAVE
VOLUNTARILY ADOPTED GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS SUGGESTED BY THE CACC. THE ROLE
OF THE CACC IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF EXISTING AND EMERGING CATALOGUES WHICH
MIGHT BECOME COMPONENTS, THE PROMOTION OF ADEQUATE ACCESS TO THOSE COMPONENTS
AND THE ASSURANCE THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE PROSPECT OF EVENTUAL LINKAGE AND
INTEGRATION OF THOSE COMPONENTS.

A LONG FAREWELL TO 'NARROW' CATCHWORDS.

THE USE OF 'NARROW' CATCHWORDS AS A PRINCIPLE ELEMENT IN CATCHWORD CATALOGUES
IS NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE. THE TERM 'NARROW' IS TOO VAGUE AND DOES NOT CONVEY
THE CONTENT AND MEANING WHICH IT SHOULD. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'
CATCHWORD HAS ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS DEFINING A CLASSIFICATION METHOD; THIS
IS HOWEVER, NOT THE CASE. LIBRARIES WOULD BE ADVISED TO CONFORM WITH STANDARD
TERMINOLOGY USED IN DOCUMENTATION AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TO AVOID FURTHER
USE OF THE 'NARROW' CATCHWORD OR 'NARROW' TERM. THE CONTROL OF CLASSIFICATION
TERMINOLOGY IS A VERY IMPORTANT AREA OF LIBRARY SCIENCE WHICH SHOULD BE MORE
CLEARLY DEFINED. EXAMINING SUCH TERMS AS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE 'NARROW'
CATCHWORD IS, THEREFORE, 1 STEP TOWARDS ELIMINATING TERMINOLOGY WHICH HAS NO
REAL MEANING OR USE.

A MODEL FOR A WEIGHTED RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.

RECENT ARTICLES HAVE ANALYSED RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS WITH CONTINUOUS WEIGHTS OF
VARIOUS TYPES AND/OR WITH A BOOLEAN STRUCTURE FOR THE QUERIES. THEY HAVE ALSO
SUGGESTED CRITERIA WHICH SUCH SYSTEMS OUGHT TO SATISFY AND RECORD EVALUATION
MECHANISMS WHICH PARTIALLY SATISFY THESE CRITERIA. OFFERS A MORE CAREFUL
ANALYSIS, BASED ON A GENERALISATION OF THE DISCRETE WEIGHTS. ALSO LOOKS AT THE
WEIGHTS FROM AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT APPROACH INVOLVING THRESHOLDS, AND
GENERATES AN IMPROVED EVALUATION MECHANISM WHICH SEEMS TO FULFIL A LARGER
SUBSET OF THE DESIRED CRITERIA THAN PREVIOUS MECHANISMS. THIS NEW MECHANISM
ALLOWS THE USER TO ATTACH A 'THRESHOLD' TO THE QUERY TERM.

A COMPARISON OF TWO SYSTEMS OF WEIGHTED BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.

A MAJOR DEFICIENCY OF TRADITIONAL BOOLEAN SYSTEMS IS THEIR INABILITY TO
REPRESENT THE VARYING DEGREES TO WHICH A DOCUMENT MAY BE WRITTEN ON A SUBJECT.
IN THIS ARTICLE A NUMBER OF CRITERIA THAT SHOULD BE MET BY ANY BOOLEAN SYSTEM
GENERALISED TO HAVE A WEIGHTING CAPABILITY ARE ISOLATED. IT IS PROVEN THAT
ONLY 1 WEIGHTING RULE SATISFIES THESE CONDITIONS; THAT ASSOCIATED WITH
FUZZY-SET THEORY; AND THAT THIS WEIGHTING SCHEME SATISFIES MOST OF THE OTHER
PROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH BOOLEAN ALGEBRA AS WELL. PROBABILISTIC WEIGHTING IS
THEN INTRODUCED AS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH AND THE 2 SYSTEMS COMPARED. IN THE
LIMIT OF ZERO/1 WEIGHTS, ALL SYSTEMS CONSIDERED CONVERGE TO TRADITIONAL
BOOLEAN RETRIEVAL.

DISCUSSES THE PARADOX OF TRADITIONAL LIBRARY CLASSIFICATION' THE AIM OF
EXPRESSING ON SUBJECT IN DETAIL IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE AIM OF PROVIDING AN
INEXPENSIVE AND USEFUL DEVICE BY WHICH BOOKS CAN BE SHELVED AND RETRIEVED.
SUGGESTS THE USE OF 2 DIFFERENT SCHEMES (OR 2 LEVELS OF THE SAME SCHEME). THE
1ST SCHEME WOULD PROVIDE CLASSIFICATION NUMBERS OF REASONABLE LENGTHS TO
ARRANGE ITEMS IN BROAD SUBJECT GROUPS WHILST THE 2ND SCHEME (OR VARIANT OF THE
1ST) WOULD PROVIDE LONGER NUMBERS FOR DETAILED SUBJECT ACCESS AND
COMPREHENSIVE BROWSING CAPABILITY IN ON-LINE SYSTEMS. THESE SCHEMES COULD BE

CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT INDICATION' HIGHLIGHTS OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN
DEBATE, 1850-1950.

DISCUSSES THE DEVELOPMENT OF UK AND US IDEAS ON SUBJECT HEADINGS AND
CLASSIFICATION FROM THE TIME OF PANIZZI'S CHALLENGE TO CLASSIFIED CATALOGUING
THROUGH THE PRACTICAL APPROACH OF CUTTER AND HULME TO THE WORK OF BLISS.
CUTTER AND HULME NEVER FULLY DEVELOPED THEIR PRACTICAL APPROACH, LEAVING THE
WAY CLEAR FOR THE THEORETICAL CLASSIFICATIONISTS SUCH AS OTLET AND RICHARDSON.
UNIVERSAL DECIMAL CLASSIFICATION WAS THE MANIFESTATION OF THEIR PRINCIPLES AND
ALSO THE BEGINNING OF A DECISIVE HISTORICAL MOVEMENT THAT CULMINATES IN THE
WORK OF BLISS. HIS GREAT VALUE IS THAT HE OFFERS AN INDEPENDENT PERSPECTIVE ON
THE HISTORY OF CLASSIFICATION AND SUBJECT INDICATION AND IS REASONABLY
ENCOURAGING ABOUT COLON CLASSIFICATION, THE SYSTEM THAT ENDED THE FORMATIVE

CONFERENCE ON THE APPLICATION OF THE SOVIET LIBRARY-BIBLIOGRAPHICAL
CLASSIFICATION BY RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN THE GDR.

A CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE GREIFSWALD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY ON 20 NOV 80 ON THE
APPLICATION OF THE SOVIET LIBRARY BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CLASSIFICATION (BBK) SYSTEM
BY RESEARCH LIBRARIES IN EAST GERMANY. THE PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE WAS TO
BRING TOGETHER MEMBERS OF RESEARCH LIBRARIES WHICH HAD INTRODUCED BBK TO
DISCUSS THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM. AS THE GREIFSWALD
UNIVERSITY LIBRARY HAD THE MOST EXPERIENCE IN THIS FIELD (19 YEARS) THEY TOOK
THE INITIATIVE IN CONVENING THE CONFERENCE. MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT LIBRARIES
GAVE TALKS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS AND PROBLEMS OF INTRODUCING BBK. ALL THE
ADVANTAGES OF BBK SHOULD BE USED WHEN ADAPTING IT TO AN EXISTING
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM AND THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF CHANGES MADE. SOME OF THE
PROBLEMS DISCUSSED WERE' ADAPTATIONS NECESSARY IN SUBJECTS SUCH AS SOCIAL
SCIENCES, MARXISM-LENINISM, BIOPHYSICS, BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR  BIOLOGY;

THE COLON IN UDC.

IN UDC A LARGE NUMBER OF SYMBOLS ARE USED TO FORM THE COMPLEX NOTATION. MOST
OF THESE SYMBOLS HAVE SEVERAL POSSIBLE MEANINGS WHICH CAUSE PROBLEMS,
ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE COLON, WHEN UDC IS USED IN AN AUTOMATED
INFORMATION SYSTEM. THE COLON IS CLEARLY INTENDED AS A SIGN DENOTING A
RELATIONSHIP NEEDING NO FURTHER DEFINITION BETWEEN 2 NUMBERS. THE USE OF THE
COLON WITH MORE THAN 2 UDC NUMBERS, ALTHOUGH UNOFFICIAL, HAS BECOME
WIDESPREAD; THE RANGE OF PERMITTED PERMUTATIONS IS DESCRIBED. WHERE THE COLON
MAY BE USED BETWEEN 2 NUMBERS, THE POSSIBLE REVERSIBILITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP
MAY BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED. IF THE POSSIBILITY OF PERMUTATION IS REMOVED THEN
THE COLON RESUMES ITS ORIGINAL FUNCTION OF DENOTING A HIERARCHIC RELATIONSHIP

QUANTITATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND NON-DESCRIPTORS IN THESAURI.

ABOUT 40 THESAURI OR COLLECTIONS OF SUBJECT TERMINOLOGY EQUIVALENT TO THESAURI
WERE STUDIED WITH REGARD TO QUANTITY RATIOS BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND
NON-DESCRIPTORS OR BETWEEN DESCRIPTORS AND A TOTAL VOCABULARY. WITH THE HELP
OF REGRESSION ANALYSIS, LINEAR CONNECTIONS WERE MADE WITH A STRONGLY
EMPHASISED CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTORS AND THE
NON-DESCRIPTORS. THEN THE NUMBER OF NON-DESCRIPTORS WAS FOUND TO INCREASE MORE
SLOWLY THAN THAT OF THE DESCRIPTORS, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE PROPORTION OF
NON-DESCRIPTORS TO THE TOTAL VOCABULARY DECREASES AS THE NUMBER OF DESCRIPTORS
INCREASES. THE INIS THESAURUS (INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR INFORMATION SYSTEM) IS
DESCRIBED IN RELATION TO THIS THEORY AND FOUND TO BE WELL PRODUCED.

USING MODERN LIBRARY AND BIBLIOGRAPHICAL CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES IN SPECIALISED
COMPUTER-BASED INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS.

THERE ARE 3 DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THE USE OF INDEXING LANGUAGES BASED ON
CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES FOR SEARCHING COMPUTER FILES FOR SUBJECT REQUESTS. THE
MECHANICAL APPROACH SIMPLY EXTENDS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CARD CATALOGUE; THE
COORDINATED APPROACH USES AS A SEARCH FORMAT A LIST OF CLASSIFICATION FEATURES
EACH SERVING A HEURISTIC FUNCTION; THE INTEGRAL APPROACH PROVIDES A SYNTHESIS
OF CLASSIFICATION AND WORD LANGUAGES WITHOUT THE DRAWBACKS OF THE OTHER 2, AND
OFFERS THE MOST LONG-TERM POSSIBILITIES. DETAILED EXAMPLES SHOW THE OPERATION

ON-LINE RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO USE, ESPECIALLY BY END USERS,
BECAUSE OF HETEROGENEITY AND COMPLEXITY. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONCERNED THE
CONCEPT OF A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE AS A MEANS TO SIMPLIFY ACCESS TO,
AND OPERATION OF, HETEROGENEOUS BIBLIOGRAPHIC RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS AND DATA
BASES. THE INTERFACE ALLOWS USERS TO MAKE REQUESTS IN A COMMON LANGUAGE. THESE
REQUESTS ARE TRANSLATED BY THE INTERFACE INTO THE APPROPRIATE COMMANDS FOR
WHATEVER SYSTEM IS BEING INTERROGATED. SYSTEM RESPONSES MAY ALSO BE
TRANSFORMED BY THE INTERFACE INTO A COMMON FORM BEFORE BEING GIVEN TO THE
USERS. THUS, THE NETWORK OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IS MADE TO LOOK LIKE A SINGLE

THE EVALUATION OF THE CONCEPT OF A TRANSLATING COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR
SIMPLIFYING OPERATION OF MULTIPLE, HETEROGENEOUS ON-LINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC
RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN. AN EXPERIMENTAL RETRIEVAL SYSTEM, NAMED
CONIT, WAS BUILT AND TESTED UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS WITH INEXPERIENCED END

ADEQUATE ON-LINE INSTRUCTION, AND A SIMPLIFIED NATURAL LANGUAGE, KEYWORD/STEM
APPROACH TO SEARCHING. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT OPERATIONAL INTERFACES OF THE TYPE
STUDIED CAN PROVIDE FOR INCREASED USABILITY OF EXISTING SYSTEMS IN A COST
EFFECTIVE MANNER, ESPECIALLY FOR INEXPERIENCED END USERS WHO CANNOT EASILY
AVAIL THEMSELVES OF EXPERT INTERMEDIARY SEARCHERS. FURTHERMO RE, MORE ADVANCED

A SYSTEM OF MEASURING THE DYNAMICS OF READING.

THE DYNAMICS OF READING CAN BE DEFINED AS CHANGES IN READING HABITS PRODUCED
AS A RESULT OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. THE LAST 15 YEARS HAVE SEEN MUCH RESEARCH
IN THIS FIELD, BUT ALL HAS BEEN RELATED TO SPECIFIC TIMES AND LOCATIONS. THERE
IS A GROWING NEED FOR A GENERAL FRAMEWORK OF REFERENCE, AND THIS PAPER
ATTEMPTS TO REVIEW SOME OF THE METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS INVOLVED. ONE SOLUTION
TO THE CHIEF PROBLEM, THAT OF MEASURING READING DYNAMICS, WAS SUGGESTED BY A
RESEARCH PROJECT AT THE LENIN STATE LIBRARY, WHICH DISCERNED 3 INDICATORS OF
CHANGE; PREVALENCE OF READING, ACTIVENESS AND CONTENT.

WITH THE RECOGNITION TODAY OF THE SUPREME IMPORTANCE OF WORK WITH CHILDREN,
NEW ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO THE EARLY ATTEMPTS TO STUDY THE READING
BEHAVIOUR OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE 1920S. BOTH LENIN AND KRUPSKAYA STRESSED THE
NEED FOR SOVIET LIBRARIANS TO GET TO KNOW THE NEEDS AND THE BACKGROUNDS OF THE
PEOPLE THEY WERE TRYING TO SERVE, BUT EARLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH INTO YOUNG
PEOPLE'S READING TENDED TO BE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC THAN ACCURATE. IN LATER WORK

CHILDREN'S LITERATURE IN ENGLISH' A SELECT, ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY, 1835-1935.

SINCE THE 1950S THE STUDY OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED INTO AN
AUTONOMOUS ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE. RESEARCH INSTITUTES AND INFORMATION CENTRES AS
WELL AS SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS IN THE FIELD HAVE PROLIFERATED. SEVERAL
SCHOLARLY PERIODICALS ARE DEVOTED ENTIRELY TO CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. CURRENT
ACADEMIC INTEREST IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE GROWING
NUMBER OF DISSERTATIONS AND THESES FOR ADVANCED DEGREES. THIS TENDENCY IS ALSO
DISCERNABLE IN SOUTH AFRICA. AN INFORMATION CENTRE FOR CHILDREN'S LITERATURE
AND MEDIA (ISKEMUS) WAS ESTABLISHED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF STELLENBOSCH IN 1978.
POTCHEFSTROOM HAS AN INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE WHICH HAS
ALREADY HELD 2 COUNTRY-WIDE SYMPOSIA AND HAS HAD A BOOK PUBLISHED UNDER ITS
AUSPICES BY TAFELBERG. ACADEMIC STUDY OF THE GENRE NECESSITATES THE FORMATION
OF COLLECTIONS OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS AND MEDIA REFLECTING THE PERSONAL BIAS AN D
INTEREST OF THE RESEARCHERS. SUCH COLLECTION BUILDING HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY
DIFFICULT BECAUSE INVESTORS REGARD FINE CHILDREN'S BOOKS AS SOUND FINANCIAL
INVESTMENTS BECAUSE OF THEIR SCARCITY. AT STELLENBOSCH A PRIVATE COLLECTION OF
ABOUT 1,000 BOOKS REFLECTS THE CULTURAL INFLUENCE OF MAINLY VICTORIAN ENGLISH

EXTRACT FROM A POSTGRADUATE DISSERTATION PRESENTED AT UFMG LIBRARY SCHOOL,
BRAZIL. WITHIN THE DISCIPLINE OF LIBRARIANSHIP, USER STUDIES ARE AN IMPORTANT

VITAL NEEDS OF LIBRARIES.

FOR YEARS NOW LIBRARIES AND LIBRARIANS IN BULGARIA HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE
EXAMPLE OF THEIR SOVIET COUNTERPARTS IN THE ORGANISATION OF LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES. TARGETS FOR BULGARIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH, TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCEMENT AND THE POPULATION'S HIGHER LIVING STANDARD IN THE 1980S MAKE THE
SIGNIFICANCE OF SOVIET LITERATURE AND PERIODICALS STILL MORE OBVIOUS.
CONCENTRATING UPON CONCRETE TASKS AND PROBLEMS IN THEIR AREA, LIBRARIANS MUST
SUPPLY THEIR READERS AND OTHERS WORKING IN LOCAL INDUSTRIES, RESEARCH
INSTITUTES, SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES WITH RELEVANT INFORMATION. SOVIET SOURCES,
SUCH AS TECHNICAL PERIODICALS HAVE BEEN MOST USEFUL IN THE PAST AND WILL
CONTINUE TO BE IN THE FUTURE. LIBRARIANS CAN RELY UPON ASSISTANCE GIVEN BY THE
STAFF AT THE HOUSE OF SOVIET SCIENCE AND CULTURE IN SOFIA. PARTNERSHIPS WITH

PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA 1979-80.

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN BAVARIA, INCLUDING THOSE RUN BY THE
LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THOSE RUN BY THE CHURCHES, IS 2,343. 94.8% OF TOWNS AND
VILLAGES LARGE ENOUGH TO HAVE THEIR OWN BRANCH LIBRARIES DO HAVE THEM. 46% OF
LIBRARIES STOCK UNDER 3,000 ITEMS, ONLY 4% STOCK OVER 30,000. IN 1980 22.5
MILLION LOANS WERE MADE TO OVER 1 MILLION READERS AND TOTAL EXPENDITURE
AMOUNTED TO 97.1 MILLION DM. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME
HAS SHOWN POSITIVE RESULTS. NEW BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED, OLD ONES
EXTENDED AND IMPROVED. THERE ARE MORE QUALIFIED STAFF EMPLOYED AND BETTER
STAFF TRAINING PROGRAMMES THAN BEFORE. AUDIO-VISUAL MEDIA, PUBLICITY WORK AND
THE REGIONAL INTER-LOAN SYSTEM HAVE BECOME MORE PROMINENT. MORE REFERENCE
WORKS ARE STILL NEEDED AND MORE LITERATURE FOR FOREIGN CHILDREN.

THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN SWEDEN.

CONTRIBUTION TO AN ISSUE DEVOTED TO PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN SWEDEN.
SWEDEN'S PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORK IS WELL DEVELOPED AND REACHES LARGE GROUPS OF
THE POPULATION THROUGH ITS OUTREACH ACTIVITIES. RECENT STUDIES SHOW THAT
ALMOST &H THE ADULT POPULATION AND 80-90% OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE
HAVE VISITED A LIBRARY IN THE LAST YEAR. MODERN DEVELOPMENTS HAVE ACCELERATED
DURING THE 1970S LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE FUSION OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES. SWEDEN
HAS NO LIBRARIES ACT, BUT THE SWEDISH PARLIAMENT DECIDED TO INTRODUCE A SYSTEM
OF STATE GRANTS TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND REGIONAL LIBRARY ACTIVITIES. STATE
GRANTS AMOUNT TO 2.5% OF THE TOTAL OPERATING COSTS OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES, BUT
THEY HAVE PLAYED A LARGE ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIES THANKS TO THEIR
STRATEGIC DEPLOYMENT.

BEING COUNTERED BY THE STATE, WHO PUBLISHES MATERIAL IN SIMILAR STYLE, BUT
BETTER CONTENT. THE LIBRARY IN SAN CRISTOBAL RECEIVES MONEY FOR STAFF SALARIES
BUT NONE FOR BOOKS. LIKE OTHER LIBRARIES, BIBLIOTECA DE MEXICO IS USED MAINLY
BY STUDENTS. THE PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICE CAME ON A MORE ORGANISED FOOTING IN

THE EXPANSION OF THE RURAL LIBRARY SERVICE IN BAVARIA WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF
THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BAVARIAN LIBRARIES.

LECTURE GIVEN AT THE 29TH CONFERENCE OF STATE LIBRARY CENTRES IN WEST GERMANY,
BURGHAUSEN, SEPT 81. BASIC PROVISION OF STOCKS AND STAFF IS STILL NOT AS GOOD
IN RURAL AS IN URBAN AREAS; FURTHER FINANCIAL PROVISION FROM THE STATE IS
NECESSARY IF LIBRARY SERVICES ARE TO BE IMPROVED. PLANS FOR IMPROVING BAVARIAN
LIBRARIES ARE LINKED CLOSELY WITH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES. EVERY VILLAGE
WITH OVER 3,000 INHABITANTS HAS A BRANCH LIBRARY AND SMALLER VILLAGES ARE
SERVED BY MOBILE LIBRARIES, MORE OF WHICH ARE STILL NEEDED. CLOSURE OF MANY
SMALL BRANCH LIBRARIES HAS RESULTED IN A CONCENTRATION OF SERVICES AND IN
INCREASED STOCKS AND READERSHIP. COOPERATION BETWEEN PUBLIC AND SCHOOL

THE VESTMANNAEYJAR PUBLIC LIBRARY HAS HAD TO STRUGGLE AGAINST POVERTY, LACK OF

STRUGGLE FOR PROPER LIBRARY PREMISES HAS TAKEN PLACE; THE LIBRARY, HAVING FEW

INTO A NEW BUILDING IN 1970. IN FEB 73 A VOLCANIC ERUPTION HIT THE HEIMAEY AND

PROBLEMS AND TASKS OF LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION.

LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION MUST MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR EXISTING PREMISES AS
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW LIBRARY BUILDINGS HAS BEEN SEVERELY RESTRICTED, AT LEAST
FOR THE TIME BEING. HOWEVER, IN SPITE OF THE CONDITIONS, LIBRARY AND
INFORMATION SERVICES MUST BE UNDER CONSTANT REVIEW WITH THEIR IMPROVEMENT IN
MIND. BRANCHES ESTABLISHED IN THE STUDENTS' HALLS OF RESIDENCE HAVE TO PROVIDE
ALL STUDENTS WITH BASIC STUDY LITERATURE. THE CENTRAL LIBRARY OF ANY
PARTICULAR ESTABLISHMENT HAS TO CATER FOR CENTRALISED AND COORDINATED
ACQUISITIONS AND PROCESSING. USE OF LITERATURE BY STUDENTS AND TEACHING STAFF
MUST ALSO BE FOLLOWED UP AND OBSOLETE ITEMS DISCARDED. GREATER ATTENTION MUST
BE PAID TO POLITICAL AND OTHER LITERATURE DEALING WITH SOCIAL SCIENCES,
ESPECIALLY IN FACULTIES OF APPLIED SCIENCE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT
AESTHETIC EDUCATION BY AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS. THE ROLE OF COMPUTERISED
INFORMATION SYSTEMS, NOW ON A TRIAL BASIS IN SCHOOLS OF ECON OMICS, WILL GROW
IN FUTURE. FOR EXPERT ADVICE LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION HAVE TO LOOK ABOVE
ALL TO THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY IN SOFIA WITH ITS METHODOLOGICAL DEPARTMENT AND
SPECIAL COUNCILS IN MANY SPHERES OF KNOWLEDGE.

AN INDIAN LIBRARIAN LOOKS AT THE PROGRESS OF AMERICAN LIBRARIES IN 1960S AND

THE PERIOD IN QUESTION SAW A RAPID GROWTH IN US ACADEMIC LIBRARIES WHICH
REACHED A PEAK AROUND 1974. LOCALISED LIBRARY AUTOMATION WAS ABANDONED IN
FAVOUR OF COOPERATIVE NETWORKS AND AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS THE RISE OF THE
PHENOMENON OF ON-LINE DATA BASE REFERENCE SERVICES SUCH AS DIALOG.
CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTI-MEDIA LEARNING
RESOURCES CENTRES. LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION BECAME LESS HIERARCHICAL IN THE
EARLY 1970S WITH MORE TRADE UNION INVOLVEMENT IN EVIDENCE. THE WORSENING
ECONOMIC SITUATION AFTER 1974 LEFT ITS MARK WITH THE DRYING UP OF LIBRARY
VACANCIES AND NOTICEABLE PRESSURE ON LIBRARY RESOURCES.

COOPERATION IN DEVENTER, 19 NOV 81. IN THE NETHERLANDS COOPERATION AMONGST
LIBRARIES OF ALL TYPES HAS COME UNDER CLOSE EXAMINATION AS A RESULT OF THE
INCLUSION OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES IN THE PROPOSED PUBLIC SERVICES ACT. THE
CONCEPT OF LIBRARY NETWORKS DATES FROM THE EARLY 1900S WHEN THE NEED FOR
LIBRARIES TO SHARE THEIR RESOURCES WAS RECOGNISED. THE MOST EFFECTIVE LIBRARY
NETWORKS ARE THOSE NETWORKS WHICH OPERATE THEIR SERVICES ON A FINANCIAL BASIS.
IN ADDITION, THE COORDINATION OF ACQUISITION POLICIES, CATALOGUING SERVICES

ADVISORY BODIES AND COMMITTEES DEALING WITH LIBRARIANSHIP IN SLOVAKIA ARE
LISTED. AMONG THE PROBLEMS TACKLED ARE NOT ONLY CATALOGUING, BIBLIOGRAPHY AND
PRESERVATION OF BOOK COLLECTIONS, BUT ALSO STANDARDISATION, RESEARCH AND
STATISTICS IN LIBRARIES, AS WELL AS CONTINUING EDUCATION OF LIBRARIANS.
SPECIAL COMMITTEES ATTEND TO THE RUNNING OF PUBLIC AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES, AND
ALSO TO LIBRARIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THE ENTIRE NETWORK IS HEADED BY THE
SLOVAK LIBRARY COUNCIL ESTABLISHED IN THE 1950S. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE
COUNCIL'S ANNUAL PLANS IS TO MEET THE TARGETS SET BY THE SLOVAK MINISTRY OF
CULTURE. FOLLOWING A CAREFUL AND THOROUGH EXAMINATION IN THE COURSE OF THE

FAIR PLAY WITH THE CAKE, YOU KNOW?'.D

ISCUSSES THE ECONOMIC CUTS AS THEY AFFECT THE LIBRARY SERVICES. THE
GOVERNMENT'S SAVINGS CIRCULAR RECOMMENDED THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES CUT LIBRARY
EXPENDITURE TO 185 KR PER CAPITA, AS, IT WAS ARGUED, PUBLIC LIBRARIES SHOWED
SIGNS OF UNCONTROLLED GROWTH. THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS, HOWEVER, CALCULATED
PUBLIC LIBRARIES' REAL GROWTH IN 1980 AS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT'S RECOMMENDED
3%; THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE LIBRARY INSPECTORATE. THE FIGURES FOR 1981
INDICATE AN AVERAGE FALL IN REAL GROWTH OF 1.4%. THE LIBRARIANS' UNION HAS
EXAMINED THE LOCAL EFFECTS OF CUTS AND FOUND THAT FRINGE SERVICES LIKE
OUTREACH ACTIVITIES ARE WORST HIT AND THAT STAFF APPOINTMENTS ARE FROZEN. THE
GOVERNMENT'S TECHNOCRATS HAVE DRAWN UP MODELS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
PUBLIC SECTOR, BUT LIBRARIANS' ANSWER MUST BE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

DANISH LOCAL AUTHORITY REFORMS OF 1970 AND THE LOCAL AUTHORITY PLANNING ACT OF
1977, WHICH EXTENDED THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE, INTENSIFIED THE DEMAND FOR A
MORE EFFICIENT PUBLIC INFORMATION SERVICE. TO SATISFY THIS DEMAND THE STATE

PURCHASING KEYS' METHODS OF CARRYING OUT IDEAS ON STOCK-BUILDING.

MUCH ATTENTION IS BEING PAID AT PRESENT TO STOCK-BUILDING PROBLEMS, INCLUDING
THE DISTRIBUTION OF MATERIAL WITHIN A PUBLIC LIBRARY NETWORK. WORKING OUT
STOCK-BUILDING PRINCIPLES CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING AND THIS IS ONLY ONE ASPECT OF
STOCK-BUILDING, EVEN IF IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. A PURCHASING KEY IS A CODING
SYSTEM FOR THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES; EXPERIENCES IN
MAGDEBURG HAVE PROVED THE KEY TO BE A USEFUL RATIONALISATION METHOD. THROUGH
THE CODING SYMBOLS THE LIBRARIAN CAN SEE QUICKLY WHAT TYPES OF LITERATURE ARE
IN WHICH LIBRARIES IN THE NETWORK. THE SYMBOLS ARE FLEXIBLE AND CAN EASILY BE
KEPT UP TO DATE. OTHER STOCK-BUILDING CRITERIA ARE LITERARY MERIT, SPECIALIST
DEMAND, FUNCTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL LIBRARIES IN THE NETWORK, NUMBERS OF READERS,
SPACE AND MONEY.

THE LIBRARY SERVICE'S REVIEWS AND LIBRARIES' BOOK PURCHASES.

FACED WITH CUTS IN BOOK BUDGETS, LIBRARIANS HAVE TO CHOOSE TO WHICH GROUPS OF
USERS THEY SHOULD GIVE PRIORITY' THOSE WHO USE THE LIBRARY MOST, I.E. THOSE
WITH HIGHER EDUCATION, OR THE MINORITY FOR WHOM THE NEED FOR MEANINGFUL
ACTIVITIES BEYOND TV AND WEEKLY MAGAZINES IN A TIME OF UNEMPLOYMENT IS GREAT.
FEARS THAT CUTS ARE MADE, NOT IN THE PULP ENTERTAINMENT LITERATURE BUT IN

LIBRARIANS GIVE IN TO POPULAR DEMAND IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE HIGH LOAN FIGURES.

WHERE POSTAL SERVICES ARE SLOW, UNRELIABLE OR EXPENSIVE, DEDICATED TRANSPORT
SCHEMES FOR INTERLENDING PURPOSES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED; THEIR USEFULNESS WILL

REGIONS WITH LESS INTERLENDING ACTIVITY. A METHODOLOGY FOR SETTING UP SCHEMES
HAS BEEN DEVISED. THE PRESENT TRANSPORT SCHEMES ARE FINANCIALLY COMPETITIVE

ON CHARGING FOR INFORMATION SERVICES.

COMMENTS ON A REPORT BY THE DELEGATION FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL
INFORMATION PROVISION' 2INFORMATION AT ANY PRICE' ON CHARGING FOR INFORMATION
SERVICES1, IN WHICH IT IS SUGGESTED THAT INTERLENDING FROM SCIENTIFIC
LIBRARIES SHOULD BE CHARGED AT A STANDARD RATE PER LOAN, DESPITE THE FACT THAT
CHARGING FOR TRADITIONAL LIBRARY SERVICES WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE COMMISSION'S
REMIT. 1 REASON FOR CONSIDERING CHARGES NONETHELESS IS THE INCREASING SCOPE
AND COST OF INTERLENDING. ANOTHER IS THE CHANGE IN THE BUDGETING OF
INSTITUTIONS FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION WHICH HAS TRANSFERRED LIBRARY ALLOCATIONS
FROM THE STATE TO THE INSTITUTIONS; THESE ARE TEMPTED TO ACHIEVE SAVINGS
THROUGH CHARGES ON INTERLENDING. THE REPORT REGARDS INTERLENDING OF LITTLE
IMPORTANCE TO PUBLIC LIBRARIES. IT DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO CALCULATE THE COST OF
INTERLENDING, NOR THE COST OF ADMINISTERING A SYSTEM OF CHARGES.

INTERLIBRARY LENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS.

INTERLENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS IS BASED ON A NATIONAL SYSTEM FOR THE SUPPLY
OF SCHOLARLY LITERATURE AND A REGIONAL SYSTEM FOR SUPPLYING A WIDER RANGE OF
MATERIAL MAINLY BETWEEN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. 725,000 REQUESTS WERE MADE IN 1979.
MOST REQUESTS ARE SATISFIED THROUGH UNION CATALOGUES OR PRINTED UNION LISTS.
IN ADDITION TO THE 12 PROVINCIAL CENTRES, THE 13 REGIONAL SUPPORT LIBRARIES
HAVE A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE REGIONAL SUPPLY SYSTEM; THEY RECEIVED 131,708
REQUESTS IN 1980 AND SATISFIED 27%. A SINGLE CENTRE IN EACH REGION IS
RECOMMENDED. A SURVEY OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM SHOWED THAT 40% OF ALL REQUESTS
AT THIS LEVEL CAME FROM ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, 40% FROM SPECIAL LIBRARIES AND 20%
FROM PUBLIC LIBRARIES. MOST REQUESTS ARE FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (60%), FOR
ENGLISH LANGUAGE MATERIAL (55% OF ALL REQUESTS; 70% OF REQUESTS FOR JOURNALS),
AND FOR MORE RECENT MATERIAL (65% PUBLISHED IN THE LAST 10 YEARS). THE
SATISFACTION RATE WAS 76% (HIGHER FOR REQ UESTS SENT TO UNION CATALOGUES): 1/2
WERE SUPPLIED IN 2 WEEKS, 2/3 IN 3 WEEKS IMPORTANT GAPS IN JOURNAL COVERAGE
WERE IDENTIFIED. AN ON-LINE NATIONAL UNION CATALOGUE WILL BE AVAILABLE IN 1984
AND WILL BE USED TO DISTRIBUTE REQUESTS MORE EVENLY BETWEEN LIBRARIES, BUT
SPECIFIC GRANTS TO SUPPORT THE INTERLENDING FUNCTION IN MAJOR SUPPLYING
LIBRARIES WILL STILL BE NECESSARY, AND CHARGES SHOULD BE MADE. IMPROVED UNION
CATALOGUES ARE ENVISAGED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL ALSO.

CORE COLLECTIONS OF JOURNALS FOR NATIONAL INTERLENDING PURPOSES.

CENTRALISED NATIONAL PROVISION FOR INTERLENDING PROVIDES A BETTER SERVICE THAN
DECENTRALISED PROVISION BUT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT, SO
PARTIAL CENTRALISATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. JOURNALS ARE SPECIALLY SUITED TO
CENTRAL COLLECTIONS. CONCENTRATION OF DEMAND ON A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF
JOURNALS MEANS THAT COLLECTIONS OF 7,000-8,000 TITLES COULD SUPPLY 80% OF
DEMAND AND 2,000 TITLES 50% IN MANY COUNTRIES. THERE ARE HOWEVER PROBLEMS IN
IDENTIFYING JOURNALS FOR CORE COLLECTIONS. BIBLIOMETRIC METHODS CAN BE SHOWN
TO BE OF LITTLE HELP. ANALYSIS OF DEMAND AT THE BRITISH LIBRARY LENDING
DIVISION INDICATES THAT RANK LISTS ARE NOT VERY STABLE OVER TIME; AND VARIOUS
FACTORS SUCH AS LANGUAGE OR STAGE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WILL CAUSE
VARIATIONS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO APPLY CORE LISTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES
(THOUGH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR DIFFERENCES, ESPECIALLY IF CORE LISTS
BASED ON CURRENT DEMAND COULD BE OBTAINED FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES). ONCE A CORE COLLECTION HAD BEEN SET UP, IT WOULD HAVE TO ATTRACT
SUFFICIENT REQUESTS TO MONITOR DEMAND AND ADJUST ITS CONTENTS ACCORDINGLY. IF
A COMPREHENSIVE COLLECTION IS NOT POSSIBLE, LIMITATION TO CERTAIN SUBJECTS HAS
ADVANTAGES. AS COLLECTIONS GROW, ADDITIONAL JOURNALS WILL BE CHEAPER TO
ACQUIRE, THOUGH THE UNIT COST PER REQUEST WILL STILL BE LOWER FOR THE JOURNALS
IN HEAVIEST DEMAND. CONCLUDES THAT THE CONCEPT OF CORE COLLECTIONS IS SOUND,
BUT FURTHER DATA ARE NEEDED BEFORE THE PRACTICAL PROBLEMS OF SETTING UP SUCH
COLLECTIONS CAN BE PROPERLY ASSESSED.

PEOPLE SHOULD BROADEN THEIR OUTLOOK: SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE 'NARROW'
CATCHWORD.

LIBRARIANS STILL COPE BADLY WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF THE NARROW CATCHWORD BECAUSE
THEIR TERMINOLOGICAL CONTROL IS STILL INEFFECTIVE. THE NARROW CATCHWORD USES
PRECISE TERMINOLOGY AND SEPARATES RELATED MATERIAL; THE BROAD CATCHWORD COVERS
WIDE SUBJECT AREAS AND TENDS TO RESULT IN THE FORMATION OF HIERARCHIES OF
SUBORDINATED GROUPS. DIE DEUTSCHE BIBLIOTHEK (GERMAN NATIONAL LIBRARY) USES
MAINLY NARROW CATCHWORDS, EQUATING THIS WITH PRECISE SUBJECT CLASSIFICATION
BUT OCCASIONALLY DEVIATIONS FROM THIS PRINCIPLE OCCUR. CATCHWORDS IN SOME
SUBJECT AREAS ARE NARROWER THAN IN OTHERS. TERMINOLOGY IS CAREFULLY CONTROLLED
AND THIS IS ESSENTIAL WHEN PRECISE TERMS ARE USED. IF PRECISE SUBJECT
DEFINITION AND STRICT TERMINOLOGY CONTROL ARE CLOSELY LINKED THEN IT FOLLOWS
THAT PRECISE SUBJECT DEFINITION CAN ONLY BE CARRIED OUT IN THE USER'S INTEREST
WHEN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF WELL-TRAINED STAFF ARE AVAILABLE.

CLASSIFICATION THEORY AND A DRAFT OF CODE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF CLASSIFIED
CATALOGUES. HIS WORK WAS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE REFORM OF LIBRARIANSHIP
DURING THE LAST DECADES OF THE 19TH CENTURY. THE LARGE NUMBER OF
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS USED BY GERMAN UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH LIBRARIES WAS
SEEN AS AN OBSTACLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC
CONTROL AND ACCESS. THE HOPE OF STANDARDISATION CAME TO NOTHING; FOCKE'S CODE
MAY EVEN HAVE HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF PERPETUATING LOCAL SYSTEMS WELL INTO
THE 20TH CENTURY. HIS WORK WAS INTRODUCED TO LIBRARIANS IN THE USA AT A TIME
WHEN SUBJECT CATALOGUING AND CLASSIFICATION WERE IN TRANSITION. HIS CODE IS

OUTLINE OF A SOCIETY OF FREELY AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

TODAY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS IN MANY FIELDS CAUSE SOCIAL CHANGES ALMOST
BEFORE SOCIETY HAS BECOME AWARE OF THEIR EXISTENCE. VERY OFTEN NEGATIVE
INFLUENCES OF CERTAIN INNOVATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED
BEFOREHAND. THIS HAS LED TO THE GROWTH OF MANY COUNTER MOVEMENTS IN SOCIETY.
IT IS NECESSARY TO FIND COMMON GROUND BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES OF 'ESTABLISHED'
AND 'ALTERNATIVE' STYLES OF LIVING, IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE CONTINUATION OF
INNOVATION IN SOCIETY. INITIATIVE, CREATIVITY AND COOPERATION, THE VITAL
FACTORS FOR TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC INNOVATION, ARE EVIDENT IN BOTH GROUPS,
ONLY OPINIONS AS TO THE BEST MEANS OF EMPLOYING THEM DIFFER. TODAY A NEW
ELECTRONIC INFORMATION NETWORK IS GRADUALLY LINKING MANKIND. THE WORLD IS
BECOMING A 'GLOBAL VILLAGE' AT LEAST ON THE LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL
COMMUNICATIONS STRUCTURES. THIS NETWORK MAY ENABLE US TO PROGRESS TO A
RATIONAL WORLD MODEL IN WHICH EVERYONE WILL HAVE A CHANCE IN  LIFE.

IN 1954, A BIBLIOGRAPHIC JOINT COMMITTEE WAS SET UP, WHOSE TASK WAS TO
COORDINATE DANISH BIBLIOGRAPHIC PUBLISHING AND INITIATE BIBLIOGRAPHIES WHERE
NEEDED. IT WAS TO ADVISE THE LIBRARY CENTRE THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LONG TERM

THIS SITUATION IS UNLIKELY TO CHANGE UNTIL THE LIBRARY COMMISSION'S PROPOSAL
FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHIC COUNCIL WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR
CONTROL OF THE NATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY AND STATE FINANCING HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED.
AS LONG AS THE LIBRARY CENTRE HAS MONOPOLY ON PRODUCTION, IT CAN DICTATE THAT
LIBRARIES MUST PAY HIGH PRICES OR ELSE MAKE DO WITH FEWER AND INFERIOR
